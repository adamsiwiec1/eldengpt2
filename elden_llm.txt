review
being killed over and over again is fun
I write this review as I have 100% completed Elden Ring. And yet, despite this, I still find new things every time I play the game.  Elden Ring is an experience to say the least, and I won't be dramatic and say it is life changing but it feels like this is THE video game to play if you're ever going to play a game. It's immersive and full of story, every little thing is made with such refined detail that you can easily miss the little things. Everything feels so interconnected and it is so easy to get lost and find yourself on an adventure. It's been a long time since I've felt like a game really wanted me to just... go explore and have fun with the world. It feels punishing but no punishment in this game goes unrewarded.  Here's my breakdown of the game, I'll try not to spoil but I'll post spoiler warnings just in case.  *Story*:  As any Fromsoft game is, the world is vague and extremely open ended. Which can be a huge mess if done wrong but this is done entirely right. Story is not handed to you on a silver platter, however if you do wish to go find it through character storylines, you're given plenty of exposition and development. Characters are made to make you care about them or hate them. A lot. Where Elden Ring shines is the characters that they weave into the story and how important bosses feel to kill due to story context. The context you are given bit by bit really sell your journey.  *The Endings*:  (I have not done Golden Mask or Dungeater's ending as they do not really interest me too much. Do note there are spoilers up ahead so skip this section if you don't want that)  -Ranni's Ending was actually one of the most satisfying endings to a Souls game I've seen in a long time. She was a compelling character and her roster of companions feel fun and diverse in their own ways. They take you on this meaningful journey with twists and questionable moral choices. And to wrap it all up nicely after taking you underground to Nokron, Fromsoft has you revisiting areas previously to ground you in Ranni's backstory via Liurnia. I 100% recommend getting this ending and I'll be posting a guide soon!  -Frenzy Flame Ending was... something? It wasn't exactly remarkable but I did really enjoy the voice acting! I can't say the way to get it was entertaining though, go through some sewers, comet azur Mohg, and take 5 minutes to jump on some graves and now you have an ending only 15% of people this game have. It didn't feel satisfying but it was visually neat and the eyes look really radical.  -Elden Lord. Nuff said, you become elden lord. A decent neutral ending!  -Fia's. This one was actually really mysterious and fun. Full of deceit and conflict. You don't get an achievement with this alas but it's worth doing. Fun bosses, neat story, Fia being based.   *Gameplay*  It takes some getting used to. I grew up on the souls games and I am used to fast paced movements. But I really had to be patient with this one! Lots of delay which forces you to pay attention to the details of certain bosses. Also adding jumping in with some of the mechanics was really neat! Albeit a bit annoying from time to time (Cough, Godfrey, Cough).  The dungeons and caves are plenty of fun and remind me of old legend of zelda mechanics. The bosses are fun and engaging, always on your toes. Although Rennala was a slight bore phase 1. You can take your time or zoom through the Main Story. Going back to back in the story takes around 2-4 hours. But there's so much to do in the game that it might take you 100+ hours to even complete it.   So, yeah. Play it.
Fun
pretty cool.
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGG
good  
Yes very hard but very fun also Berserk.
The game is super amazing and fun, easy to control and learn. Fighting combos are easy but annoying part is some cheaters ruining this game and of course sometimes lags can frustrate you if you are in invasion and playing in colossal arena 
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING
Liar Ahead!
ez
As open world as it gets. It's my first From software game but I'm sure I'm going back to play all of them after this
Game of the year.
I got 60+ hours into the game, before a friend asked me if i had killed the first story boss, i had no fucking idea... what a wild ride.  10/10 Would die again.
gut
Honestly fun, challenging boss fights. Keeps the mechanics of previous titles, and makes it more friendly for new players as they can just explore and come back later.   A vast arsenal, and chances are you can use the weapon you want to use because for most non unique weapons you can add weapon arts to them. These weapon arts increase damage/ let you choose what they scale with, and add a new ability onto them.  Plenty of spells, and most of them all generally have their uses, some for insane cheese (Dragon rot breath, Comet Azur). The most frustrating thing about them, is that enemies input read to dodge your shots, so delaying and or just trying to get a quick hit will normally be futile. The counter to the enemy dodge, is to just do it again. For some reason they decided that the ai should only be able to dodge a certain amount of times.  And leading on from my last point: Bows, I am doing a bow only build, it is painful to just have the game decide half of your shots aren't going to hit, and if you try to attack while a boss is channeling something, generally the bow will lock you out of dodging away. Unless you are using a composite bow/ a quick bow that has a dodge attack you will be hit if your not a mile away from the boss. Using a small bow to relieve these issues kind of suck, as they are only really useful for applying status effects and not damage. Though it is understandable that bows should be weaker, but when you compare them to mage/faith counter parts it feels rough.  Biggest downside to me of this game is [strike] it's not darksouls 4. [/strike] is that the open world kind of makes the game less linear, which is what appealed to me in ds3. (Which is a great game that I highly recommend)
fuck godrick :)
I'll keep it short with this one. I have played a truckload of games since I've been a little kid.  Elden Ring is the best game I have ever played. Simple as that. This is an absolute masterpiece, challenging in all the right ways, an immersive world with a unique atmosphere that pulls you in, story bits that you can discover yourself, loads of hidden content that rewards exploration, epic boss fights, a perfect scaling of game difficulty with your learning curve, incredible graphics, incredible soundtrack, immense replay value, rewarding combat, deep RPG elements, a huge selection of very different armaments, spells and equipment.  This game takes you serious as a dedicated player and shows exactly what western adventure/RPG/AAA games have been lacking so badly over the last... 10 years? I've finished the game 1 month after release and I'm still constantly coming back to it.  FromSoftware, you outdid yourselves with this one. This is the one in a million, this is literally the best game ever made.
Top-notch gameplay and graphics, not so good "story".
Stunning
This game is definitely a worthwhile playthrough for anyone who may take the slightest interest in this genre. Though, I must say this game's end game does not have the most polish when compared to the beginning of the game. Bosses are overly punishing and overly active. The philosophy of bosses seems to have been very muddied. Bosses with large health pulls will have attacks capable of nearly one-shotting any build that does not dump vigor. Most early-game bosses are challenging, but well made enough to be beaten at any point in the game depending on skill level. The later bosses are very different on the other hand. The over-aggressive nature of bosses and their habit to end combos just to immediately begin a new one before you can properly achieve a hit is an incredibly frustrating one. Leaving you to always be overly cautious in order to even get an attack in. Forcing the players to constantly be on the defensive and break the flow of combat creates a less interesting environment and gameplay loop. It seems like the developers decided to focus on making the bosses more "challenging" rather than fun. Bosses being challenging is a perfectly fine mechanic and is fundamental to the franchise, but Elden Ring seems to tip the scales, several times, into the frustrating territory. Having to wait an entire Youtube Ad's length of time for a proper opening in a boss only to do minimal damage is just not a fun way to play the game. Spending several minutes whittling a massive health bar, only to be instantly killed by singular mistake is not a fun way to play a game. Bosses with small health pools that are incredibly punishing are completely fine and enjoyable challenges. Bosses with massive health pools that spend most of their time whittling you down for your mistakes over time are also completely fine and enjoyable. It's when the two are mixed, is when you create an overall frustrating experience. Do not get me wrong. I love this game and enjoyed the many hours I put into it, but the game's late game bosses make it a difficult choice to want to replay it. 7/10 game trapped in a 10/10 frame. I would love to see this game get a sequel that irons out the issues.
Noice game :))
Masterpiece
A fantastic take on open world game design. Highly recommend to anyone interested in lore rich games that inspire curiosity and exploration within the player.
PRAISE THE SUN
This is my first souls game and honestly, knowing it's a souls game makes it easier to digest that you're supposed to die A LOT before you "git gud". Absolutely deserved the Game of the Year with it's art, story, music, and gameplay altogether!
bought the game at launch, played 10-15 hours, didn't like it.  and then i got good
the best among the dark souls series
It really makes you "feel" like you're the Elden Lord
FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL, BEAR WITNESS!
best game i have ever played!
good replayability
So good that I expect that I will never experience a better game. A single playthrough can take anywhere between 50 and 150 hours (or even longer), and the replay value is incredible. I've completed three playthroughs so far, and each one was a distinct experience.
Thank god for Ronien mf carried me through the first boss by the castle. 10/10 would play again. I despise that knight tho in the dark room. My only feedback would the the ability to summon ronien (I think that was his name?) every boss and miniboss as a permanent ally because I suck at viedogames.
I thought I already provided a review here... I've played for over 348 hours. I'm doing my third run a year after I left the game. I bought it because a friend asked me to, it ended being the best purchase in years.  I enjoyed being a full noob, playing with my friend and having long calls in Discord to learn more about the different tactics and farming places.   I stopped playing when my friend passed away a little over a month after we became tarnished, a small detail he defeated leuchemia twice before becoming immortal. He did everything he could and more.   Now I'm back at it, his son suggested to play it together now that a DLC is coming so I agreed.   I'm almost 39, I play to relive memories but also to gain new ones. This is one of those games that make it possible.
gas
S-Tier world building, aesthetics, and action-RPG game-play. This masterpiece has a lot to offer.  The music isn't as memorable this time around, and the inter-connectivity of the levels isn't as intricate as their previous titles, but nothing is perfect. The open world exploration is rewarding. The quests are hard to figure out, and often leave a sour taste in your mouth. It's a beautifully dark world that rewards skill and planning.

rot swamp
What can I add to the conversation about Elden Ring that hasn't already been said? Nothing. If you've been living under a rock and somehow haven't heard about this game, well give it a bit. Somebody will undoubtedly proselytize you in the name of Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin soon.
Nearly as good as Darksouls 3
Likely my new favourite game. I highly recommend to new and veteran Souls players.
Lacks in replayability but still an amazing experience
Hidetaka Miyazaki definitely has a thing for blind women, bare feet and possessed dolls right
Good shit
sucks
<3 Just play it
Way overrated. Roll simulator while casting spells.
This is the first time i have ever played a game like this. I went from playing CoD and Space Engineers to Elden Ring, i have become obsessed and absolutely recommend this game.
coudnt beat = ass
me use sword, sword kill and am satified. grug like game. it good game
Open world and very challenging. Took many hours of game play to complete all achievements. Playing through additional characters is also rewarding.
we all got that one homie who is unfit even to graft
10/10 get your very own elden bling today!
HELLA HARD BUT ITS FUN (Pause.)
I have never liked a souls game as much as I love this game. It has a lot of replay value that will make you want to get everything this game has to offer.

i hate this game
masterpiece
after awhile i can be able to learn the attack pattern of rain to not get wet
I already beat this game on PS5 and loved it so much I bought it on PC as well. It's probably going down as one of my favorite games of all time, for all the same reasons everyone else loves it.
big boss make me anger
breathe of the wild but crazy
I mean what else do i have to say its elden ring 10/10
I love this game, but it also makes me want to rip my hair out.
elden ring georg, who lives in a cave and plays 100 hours per character, is an outlier and should not have been counted.
why is it always mushroom?
The best RPG I ever played.
Unironically one of the best games ever made, sincere opinion
"I offer you an accord."   Elden Ring is truly FromSoftware at its peak, while I love the Dark Souls games, I think Elden Ring's world and lore are by far my favorite. The characters all feel like they are moving towards their own goals, and you are just a pawn for most of them. By the end of the game you could accept your fate or align your goals among one of these many characters, or flip everything on its head for yourself. I think the endings for the game are very interesting, and investigating to learn the lore of the game for myself was very fun for me! The design of characters and bosses in this game is also very interesting, as some have strange connections to the lore that lead you to learning more as you examine and play. Some just make for good mysteries too, leading you to craft your own theories about things. While I hope we get more explanations for things in future DLC's I'm also fine with things remaining mysterious, as it allows everyone to keep their own theories about the game. Gameplay feels a lot smoother than the clunkiness of the other Souls games I've played too. As a heavy greatsword builder I've also never been happier with how easy it is to achieve the build you're going for.  The soundtrack is also killer, as most souls games are when it comes to their tracks. Wandering the world had to be my favorite part of the game, whereas in other Souls game, trekking along can feel like a drag.   I look forward to more! Truly one of the best games I've played.
I have an 06 honda accord
has big dogs, small dogs, even pop dog
Nice Game
Great
:)
funny
no clue what im doin but having fun
Go to get them rings.
maleinia made me want to unalive
Yes... Buy the game. Don't wait for a sale... you'll regret not paying the developers later. Wish I could experience this again for the first time.
got a gf irl but they still call me maidenless ffs
Should you play Elden Ring?  FromSoft and the Soulslike genre certainly have a strong, dedicated following, but maybe that's not you. Perhaps you've never played this kind of game before and you aren't sure if you can trust they hype. I humbly offer my perspective, as someone who entered the world of Elden Ring (hereafter referred to as the Lands Between) with absolutely no experience with other FromSoft games or the brutally unforgiving genre from which it arose.  I finally took the leap and bought Elden Ring because I love exploring open worlds. Linear gameplay can be great, but there is something especially appealing to me about a huge world that I can wander through freely, especially those with a sword-and-sorcery aesthetic. From RuneScape and Guild Wars to the Elder Scrolls and The Witcher, just give me a sword, a bow, some spells, and a world to get lost in.  Here was a new world to explore in the Lands Between, and please believe me when I say I was not disappointed. The Lands Between are at times beautiful, terrifying, breathtaking and disturbing. The world is vast, and it seemed that every time I thought I had explored it all, there was still another hidden area to unlock and explore. This amazing world seemed all the bigger, I think, because of how small I felt in it.  I am just an average gamer, no slouch but nothing to brag about either. My early experience in the game involved dying (a lot) to very basic enemies. I crept slowly through every cave and dungeon, constantly on guard for wolves and imps waiting to jump out at me. When I encountered my first dungeon boss, I probably fought and died a hundred times, determined to beat it (not realizing at the time that I was just too weak, underleveled for the fight, and really should have moved on and come back later). It was frustrating, but I loved the world and I was determined to explore it all.  So... should you play? It is an excellent game on many levels, and I can attest that it is accessible (with a learning curve) to gamers new to the genre. That said, I would only recommend Elden Ring if you have patience and can emotionally tolerate repeated failure. While the open world design offers more freedom to avoid the hardest fights until you've leveled up, there are still some very challenging enemies that can take multiple attempts to defeat. If getting killed by the same boss for the twentieth time might make you punch your screen, maybe look elsewhere.  But if you are willing to learn and grow from defeat, and especially if you love exploring vast new worlds, then I hope you take a chance and journey into the Lands Between. Elden Ring is an experience you likely won't forget anytime soon.
boing nboing boign boing
O you don't have the elden ring, O you don't have the elden ring.
try finger but hole
Think this is the first game I've ever reviewed in my years of playing on steam so here goes nothing... This sh*t slaps.
FPS are capped at 60.
Rykard's wife eats him out
Good game
The profound impact that the first Dark Souls had on me during high school left me skeptical that Elden Ring could be as meaningful to me as an adult. I was close to skipping it altogether, but my friends convinced me to give it a shot with the Seamless Co-Op mod last month. Although we didn't make much progress as a group, I had a blast finishing the game solo.  Even though I started playing Elden Ring a year after its release, I believe that it was worth the full price of admission. I had some issues with the game's pacing, particularly with regards to the open-world exploration, but the stunning landscapes and compelling lore made the journey worthwhile. Now, I find myself eagerly anticipating the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, even if I am not quite as hyped as I was for the Crown of the Sunken King back in 2014.
dumb game for fat dumb babys
like
It's a very good game and overall a great experience. It will also keep you entertained for a while.
installed a randomizer mod, got to the first boss after the tutorial boss, and proceeded to get domed by the fire giant. 10/10 would recommend
dont google things dont youtube things it gets slightly less fun
goo
hgbrw
10/10, best game I've ever played!
Rise, Tarnished!!!
fucking good
Good
I played this game for about 8 hrs., and haven't come back to it. It is about the most boring game I have ever played. Within the 1st hr., I had come across bada** gear and was kicking the crap out of everything I came across. That includes the bosses. Boring as hell. Visuals were great, but they're not worth paying for.
100% recomend this game. From Software is a great game studio if you are on the ropes about buying this game dont be if you like a challenge when it comes to playing games this game is for you! its so fun but very hard haha
this being my first souls like game i find that as hard as it might be most of the time it keeps me wantng to keep trying to get a little further everytime
10/10, 16 hours nonstop smiling :)
best game ever
bleed is a bit weak ngl
The best and most variety and freedom filled instalment in this pseudo series
yes
dop3e
this game is a must buy
It was super fun until post-capital. Then the game starts becoming an uninteresting slog for the next half of the game. All the area's after the Atlas plateau just kinda suck. The re-use of enemies/bosses become super apparent As many early game bosses become normal enemies in the late game which is super dis-jarring. Not to mention one of the main super important bosses (godrick) gets re-used in his first phase as an evergaol boss? That's just goofy as all can be. The game would've been a lot better if it was smaller for sure. As places like the mountaintop of giants and concentrated snowfields aren't fun to explore. Hell you can't even see in most of the snow fields to actually explore the area. Also. The haligree tree is genuinely such a pain in the arse. I had more trouble getting to melania then fighting her? I don't know. I just cannot reccomend this game as the last half is just not fun at all. Atleast a lot of the big bosses were fun. Except Ranala, and the Elden Beast because they both kinda just sucked. Melania and Radahn were stupidly fun bosses to fight.
What is there to say. PLAY IT!
That's tha good shit!
You Have Died!!! Amazing Game !!
gsad
***YOU DIED***
BUY THIS GAME AND TOGETHER... WE CAN DEVOUR.. THE VERY GODS!
one of the best games ive played. always somthing new and challenging. cant wait for the dlc!
I like the game its a improved dark souls set in a fresh world. The reason I cant recommend it is even after a year the game still stutters even on a beefy rig. I have updated my drivers reinstalled the game ete.
big
Run run RUUUUUNNNNNN FOR LIFE IS AMAZING THING TO PLAY!
One of the greatest games ever. Beautiful sprawling open world that gives the sense of freedom, adventure, and danger we felt gaming as children. The first 40-50 hours of this game are pure unadulterated art. It's rare an open world game makes me *want* to explore, but the mystery danger and lack of markers in Elden Ring had me checking everywhere. Several absolute banger "dungeon" levels.   Combat is tight and responsive, weapons have a weight that feels appropriate for their size. There are a variety of different builds, styles, and choices based on personal preference and skill. The game even includes Ash Summons which can help new players wade their toes into the water of souls games.   The game stumbles a bit near the end especially with tuning on some fights, but even then has a few of my favorite fights that really help it get over the finish line as a top 5 all time for me. Dark Souls 1 had a similar issue with its post O&S content, and if I can forgive that, I can certainly forgive this one when it throws several of its best fights near the end. There's even a JRPG style super boss that anyone with any familiarity at all with the series is well aware of, given she tells you her name each of the hundreds of times she will kill you  9.5/10   Total Banger
👍👍👍
it is soooooooo good
The single greatest game I have ever played : incredible challenge, a stunningly beautiful true open world, a plethora of possible play styles, a gorgeous soundtrack, a true and rare feeling of adventure and an epic tale in a world full of lore and powerful characters  I can only recommend this game, don't listen to the critics and live a true adventure
One of my fav games
Iron Fist Alexander, true heir to the Elden Throne. I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here. Long live the true Elden Lord!
better than skyrim
SIIIIIII
Finished the game on my PS4 and even tho it was mostly in 25 fps I still enjoyed every minute of it(except the Godskin Duo, fuck those bozos).Now I bought the game again because it's that good
I am elden lord - 10/10
this game is amazing
Game is fun.  Wish there were more options for Co-Op, after beating solo I would like to see a more open experience with friends.
For those who like a game that is difficult for the sake of being difficult this is your game. and dont expect that to stop when you try and play with your friends either. this game has the worst multiplayer system i have ever seen. at best you can kill a boss or two with your friend before having to restart the entire multiplayer process which takes resources that have to be farmed.
Short game but otherwise it's pretty good
great and beautiful game
I had to modify my PC for HOURS to get this game to run smoothly.
it gud 
good
Hands down one of my favorite games.
games good 
10/10
60 FPS capped? In this day and age? Absolutely Pathetic.
Fun game ^_^
best
Awesome
Fantastic, one of the best RPGs I've played. Can't wait for the DLC.
PAIN
hehe uchigatana go brrrr
As many have said, it's quite an adventure and definitely worth playing for souls fans and anyone who likes a true action rpg. It's certainly not a 10/10, but not for lack of content. In fact, the game would've benefited from a few features/areas being cut.  There is easily a full game's worth of unique content here, looking at the scale of the world, the number of areas, weapons/spells, and bosses. However, a lot of the content is repeated to the extent that the game is the scope of 2 or 3 full games. So instead of a normal-sized game where everything is unique and has a purpose, the game has a lot of re-used content and is a bit bloated. So after the 80-ish hour mark, the scope of the game actually works against itself, in my opinion.  The first 40 or 50  hours are sheer bliss and rival my best experiences playing almost any other game, but it falls off bit by bit as you explore more of the worlds areas, finding nearly identical catacombs or caves, consumables that just have a different coat of paint, the same ruined churches/enemies, and mini bosses that are re-used over and over with slight alterations or coupled with other enemies for increased challenge.  enemy and item placement is generally fantastic, and i always felt like the developers were right next to me, watching me play and placing everything by hand. So even when the content is re-used, exploring is still pretty engaging because there are very few empty dead ends.  The overall narrative is intriguing, but any actual explanation of the characters/world/who you are/etc are pushed so far to the sidelines that my biggest bit of positive feedback on this front is that it doesn't get in the way of the experience. And I'm absolutely forced to mention that characters' names are just unbearably similar, I really have no idea what they were thinking here. They took so many liberties with the narrative that they seem to have said to themselves "it's probably better if it just doesn't make any sense and leaves the world in a state of mystery." I'm not sure I agree.  I'm tempted to say that the core systems (that is, the combat, menus, and upgrades) are excellent, but honestly there are some big holes in the experience that I can't overlook. It's difficult to summarize, but certain aspects of the game are too obscure considering how critical they are to the whole of the experience. Magic is a great example, as summons, incantations, and sorcery and more are all handled differently and are obscure enough that I wouldn't blame players for skipping most of these mechanics entirely. Sorcery in particular involves finding a specific NPC in the world that is hidden in a copy-paste hole in the ground that could EASILY be overlooked given the size of the world. Summons are granted through the use of an item which is obtained through an NPC that only appears during one part of the game's day/night cycle (which influences very few other parts of the game afaik), and incantations require equipping and using "seals," which is not very obvious. All these things and more are likely explained/hinted at early in the experience but given how much is thrown at you, it's impossible for all of it to stick.  Although it's sort of magical how every game mechanic is veiled in an in-world name (Runes = XP, Ashes of War = special skills for weapons, "Tears" are health flask upgrades, etc), this makes for a very, very laborious process of trying to figure out if an item is even important or not. Speaking of importance, consumables make up a lot of the loot in the game, and in a game where the biggest challenges is bosses which will regain all their health when you die, consumables seem meaningless to me. My first 5 attempts at the more difficult bosses will just be learning attack patterns.  Crafting is pointless because you only craft one-time-use consumables which I've already stated that I find useless. Crafting should've been excluded entirely from the game but I'd guess it was left in as an additional incentive to explore/revisit ares of the map.  'Questing' is executed poorly enough to be a considerable net negative on the experience. NPCs appear in different places seemingly at random and the world is simply too big for this too be acceptable, especially without a questlog of some sort.   There are a few types of loot that I was always happy to find: Smithing Stones (used to upgrade weapons), Talismans (usually stat modifiers that can be easily swapped out to sort of re-spec your character on the fly), armaments/armor, and Runes. Every other bit of loot was almost always pointless and I would shrug and say to myself, "well, exploring and killing enemies is its own reward.   Talismans are great and maybe one of my favorite systems in the game. XP and weapons/gear are pretty straightforward, as loot at least. Smithing Stones, however, change the game in an important way that I love and hate, and ultimately wish was different. Upgrading weapons means that you can stick to certain weapons long after they should be obsolete, which is good in that you can use your favorite weapons for most of the playthrough, but because some weapons are so much better in terms of DPS than others, i found myself using only 3 different weapons during 90% or more of my 160 hours. There are an insane number of interesting weapons, so it's a shame that I never saw a path to success by trying lots of different ones. Smithing stones are also a pain-point in that finding a specific 'level' of stone is required to upgrade each stage of the weapons' power. what this means, is that at times, A level 7 smithing stone may be more valuable than an 8 or 9, simply because your weapon's upgrade is gated at each level and you might have run out of 7's. Still, smithing stones are always an exciting find and make exploring fun.  I'm not going to say much about the visuals; in terms of asthetics the game is an easy 10/10. It's truly a breathtaking game and I can't count how many times I said to myself during my playtime "wow. I've never seen anything like that before."  Audio is great, OST is pretty spectacular and the music always matches the tone of the situation it accompanies.  Last thing I want to cover is bosses, which are sort of a mixed bag. I'm not surprised this is a big point of contention for the community; some of them are very fun once you get the hang of their moveset, while others are just simply too cruel and unfair to be enjoyable or satisfying once you've conquered them. Almost every boss requires carefully timed dodges and a mastery of stamina management and character building. That's fine. What really isn't fine is bosses reading player inputs to trigger attacks the exact moment you do something, bosses that track perfectly, forcing dodge rolls instead of just clever footwork, absurdly long combos, Multiple boss phases, incorrect or very sloppy hit boxes and one hit kills. A boss could have one or two of the above and still be a fair fight, but I'd say the majority of the main bosses (and quite a few of the minibosses) have most or all of those features. I'm not saying any of the bosses aren't possible with time and effort, I'm saying a lot of them aren't very fun. Given the various types of character builds, the length of the game, and the fact that co-op is potentially part of the experience, I think the devs erred on the side of making bosses too overpowered, unfair, or tedious. If fighting bosses was less common I might give this a pass, but such a large percent of my playtime was spent in boss encounters (often fighting a new boss immediately after beating a previous one), that I really just got tired of the experience and wanted it to end.  Now, this review has mostly focused on the negative features of the game, but I think the positives more than make up for it. This is really a breathtaking epic experience that, despite being flawed, is definitely worth a recommendation. Game of the Year? Maybe. 10/10? nope.
Great game!
everytime i played this i wanted to cry 10/10
the game is about death. you die and then you die. then game complete
This has to be better than sex right
i mean its okay

Definitely the greatest game.  This is my second souls game after Dark Souls 1 which I didn't complete because of its oldness. So many emotions left, so many I experienced. Very beautiful different regions mixed with truly challenging bosses, environments, mobs.
wowowowowowowowowowoowowowowio
I finally figured out how to swing my sword, now to go get the first quest from that guy on the horse!

FROM SOFTWARE DOES IT AGAIN
A masterpiece of a game. It was my first introduction to the souls games and it didn't disappoint.   Challenging and worth the money
So many amazing things were achieved with Elden Ring, and although its undeniably a masterpiece and genius in terms of world building and design. There are significant issues that might ruin the game for a lot of the player base, especially on subsequent play-through's.   With the exception of Godrick being a near perfect boss in terms of gameplay and design aesthetic. The boss quality of Elden Ring doesn't match up to their previous titles, Dark Souls 3 notably. Pretty much every main story boss in the game has at least one attack or more that is unreactable or purely unfair, with the end game bosses being the biggest offenders. But I will say that even though this may be an issue in terms of game design, Elden Ring is probably the easiest game Fromsoft has made given all the resources that are offered to you in game.  Upon first play-through, someone might not have a problem running through the many side dungeons in the game because the act of finding a secret in the world adds spectacle, but this also has to do with the fact that most players wont know that the layouts and enemies used in these dungeons are reused over and over again, with little nuance. The side dungeons in Elden Ring are basically just the chalice dungeons from Bloodborne but worse; because Instead of getting something useful as a reward from a chalice dungeon like you would in Bloodborne, because of the extreme build diversity in Elden Ring, you are going to get something completely useless to your specific build ninety percent of the time. In addition to the side dungeons, certain bosses like the Ulcerated Tree Spirit are reused at least 10 times if you go through the trouble to find them all. Fromsoft has handled reusing bosses in the past very well but it isn't done well here. With all this in mind you might think that, "Well maybe you're only SUPPOSED to have one good play-through.". But this just isn't the case when you factor in the sheer number of different builds and weapons you can use and the fact it has a New Game + option.    Considering the many flaws this game has, it doesn't stop this game from being one of the best games I have ever played. And without any of these flaws, Elden Ring would be undeniably one of the best games ever made. But it might still be up there even with its flaws.   So maybe I just typed all of this out for zero reason.  -20/10
yo this game fun fr
Make it harder
just YES
Very good game, going thru it for the 3rd time, theres always something new you will find... If you enjoy HUGE open world games without much of a guidance and you love to explore and fight various enemies then this game is definetely for you! Enjoy!
Just damn... Must play

Best game
theres a bit of reuse and recycle in this game but certainly none of the reduce.  probably my favorite game so to this day, hoping the best for the dlc.
Great game
While I do recommend this game, understand before going in that 65% of this game is cruel and often needless suffering, 20% is fun gameplay, and 15% is story and lore that you need a Bachelor's in English to parse properly.
i guess it's ok
holy fuck this game is good
It's Elden ring. What more can I say? It's the perfect open-world game.
Playing for the first time in 2023.Had this on my wishlist forever. So far its living up to the expectations. Must play for anyone.
It's good 👍
After 100 hours, godricks great rune is all I have to show. But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy every second of grind.
try finger but hole

GOTY? nah Game of the decade

Why is it always try finger, but hole?
THE ELDEN RING DLC IS REALLLL!!
This game is a masterpiece as an open world RPG.  Basically I hate "Souls" game in general because what most of the players describe as difficulty it's just out dated console gameplay with input buffer, input delay and under optimised camera work, if you're a PC player it's just the opposite of your usual experience.  But even if, as me, you don't like Souls gameplay, give it a shot. I honestly think this game is worth to buy just to discover the world without fighting anything.
Can summon jar man 10/10.
Elden Ring is a beautiful and rewarding experience, regardless of how far you manage to progress the story or side quests. I could not recommend this title enough to anyone looking for a challenge and a top-tier fantasy RPG experience.
Leziz bir şey bu oyun
Even tho im only 17h in on PC, i did a full playthrough, missing only the optional endings on the PS4.  There is nothing more to add on what you already eard about Elden Ring, however, i want to give my opinion on the game.  Being this my second playthrough, now on PC, im surprised im still having a BLAST playing this again.  The first time you enter the Lands between, it's a magical experience as the world is full of things to discover, hidden paths that lead to places you already visited or not, or even get teleported into the skies.  There is nothing quite like this game in the sense that the world is carefully crafted to the tinniest detail.  As i read on a review a couple of months ago, this game is on sale even at full price.  Don't sleep out on the Lands between, its a masterpiece.
Exploration here is everything. Elden Ring is an RPG. Rather, it's a game that elevates role-playing to the point of realism. You are a stranger in a land as strange as your avatar. Some of the basic controls and mechanics are explained in the past for the game's tutorial. But that's about it. no mission log There is no mini map with icons. There are no screen overlays or bread crumb trails telling you what to do next. or even where to go otherwise have to learn Whether deciphered from in-game italic item descriptions or gathered from the precious internet community. Death is not so much an avoidable setback as a necessary provision on the path to enlightenment. It might sound scary in theory. But in practice it's exciting. Every inch of progress in Elden Ring feels earned and therefore infinitely more rewarding and Elden Ring is a very difficult boss game. OPEN AND HANDS-OFF EXPLORATION I haven't enjoyed the open world much since Red Dead Redemption 2. It's hard, satisfying, and a great game!
Its pog
fun
Very hard but very rewarding
The best game in the universe. Enough said.

From Software is still a dev company we can have faith in.
Pretty fun
praise da sun
malenia first try btw
Is fun. Would recommend.
good
Best game ever made!!!
behold, hidden path ahead
Absolutely great game I've almost beat every boss Can't beat Rick Soldier of God

Elden Ring, is my first-ever darksouls game. After spending a good 30 hours on it, I wrote this review to reflect on how I feel about it. The game is quite challenging, and I'm not even going to sugarcoat it. Despite its difficult progression, the game offers so much possibility and exploration with its beautiful views, that it just leaves me admiring it every once in a while. The fighting mechanics and hitboxes are an 11/10, I very much love the weapons and magical effects. The only thing I dislike about this game, would probably be horse parkour. Sometimes the spectral steed Torrent, loves to jump or walk a few extra steps and that really messes up attempting to get to the bottom or top of places. Other than that,  I give this game a big fat 9.9.
good
I want a finger maiden
Yes just yes
Its good game but my mentality is broken
Amazing
This game would be 10/10 but the stuttering issues make it super frustrating. How have the developers not fixed this problem by now? The feeling when your about to beat a hard boss fight and then a stutter makes you get hit and die.... GET YOUR SHIZ TOGETHER FROM SOFTWARE! (YES, ive tried the fixes. i shouldnt have to to try anything like that anyways)
da best co op mode great too
noice
WOuld recommend no cap, quite a bit of boobs ig... (not enough for me tbh) The dogs are great though love it!!
First game in years that I played over a 100 hours within a couple of weeks. Thy who shall reach Elden Ring shall become Hermit for thy weeks.
Amazing game play and probably the most amazing game design I've seen in years.
YUP
good!
perfect 10/10
fairly difficult
GOTY for a reason. This is what I wanted from the future when I played Morrowind as a kid.
Ever since I started playing this game I have accrued an endless supply of maidens to help me cope with the fact that I will never finish this game.
This is my first FromSoftware game, but it won't be my last. The world is vast, horizontal and vertical. I'm amazed how they fit such a big world into a 40 GB game, it's pretty impressive.  The plot...well, you'd have to be a tracker, online guide reader, or completionist to really understand what's going on. I really only got the main plot, but even that was well over 90 hours.  Epic large open world, dark and eerie. Not for everyone, but as of this writing there are over 20 million copies, so maybe there is something for everyone.  YOU WILL DIE MANY TIMES!  8/10

"Try fingers But hole"
Awesome game...
Great game for people who are new to souls games its unique in its own right with still capturing the spirit of a souls borne game.
Dog
fun

Amazing once you get into it
Games trash
Great game, maybe it's my souls bias. most bosses are fun ( mohg is kinda stupid with that phase 2 transformation which just forces you to heal, with no way of avoiding the damage. I would be fine with that if it just healed him, but the fact that it forces you to take damage with no way around it IMO is straight donkey cock.) there are a couple I have problems with, mad pumpkin is my favorite of all the bosses I have fought(But my actual favorite boss is melania, Phase 1 is a breeze. Sure the health regain is a tough punish to deal with but with patients its not that hard to dodge and weave around her. Phase 2 though was extremely hard[atleast for me] she was faster and the bloom got me way more than it should, my stupid ass just running into it. had to fight the camera lock sometimes cause she would fly off my screen.Probably took me around 30 attempts to kill the cretonne.) . The exploration is really fun and is what got me to spend so much time in the game, cool environments rewarding you for searching them thoroughly while having secrets and alternate paths for most of the venture. Don't have too much to say about the normal mobs the populate the world, due to the fact that I just run past them to go straight to the end of what ever dungeon or area I happen to be in. Just do not really feel rewarded fighting them, their pretty hollow. The story was fun to follow although a confusing mess since its open world and I had no straight linear path to follow. All in all considered I think this game sits at my 6th favourite in my list of games.   8/10    Definitely give it a try if you like the soulsbourne games
Good game, very fun, relatively difficult, malenia sucks. Would recommend
One of the best games ever made.
Endless exploration of fascinating world and mechanics
will take your soul away but its the good kinda pain. perfection.
It is just an amazing game.
\o/
i do highly recommend this game, i have enjoyed it very very much, i also do recommend for new players to the souls games if i'm honest it is by far the easiest souls game made by from software, if it had the title dark souls it would be the easiest dark souls game, now this doesn't mean the game isn't challenging, making builds still takes time to get right, enemies can and will one shot you, bosses can and will most of the time one shot you, but once you progress further into the game and become better you can limit one shots, there are lots of armor and weapons to use, even though i've said this would be the easiest dark souls title if it had the title do not expect it to be something as easy as a hack and slash game it will challenge you, the story is very hard to pick up at times for the most part like me you wont even know what it is like 60% of the time, it is def a recommend play, you will enjoy it as a i have, you will create your own story to become elden lord while also completing other story lines that are taking place during your own, you will find things the second time you play or going back into the area you didn't spot the first time.  i def recommend it!  tldr: good game, highly recommend, easy but will challenge.
great game, just dont rage quit cus skill issue!
good
nice
hidetaka miyazaki and george r. r. martin created a beautiful world with a vast history and mythology. if you like the politics and characters of a song of ice and fire, lord of the rings, and/or the witcher, you will enjoy this universe. there are some amazing lore videos  on yt about elden ring and the lands between. if you delve into the lore i promise your game experience will be elevated! it feels like i learn something new every time i play.  i've had the most fun playing builds and with items i think are cool. there are so many options that pretty much any build is possible. the game is mostly easy with help from co-op. if you want to challenge yourself play solo or with summons for a bit, but try online play because it is really fun. you can go at your own pace and do most things in any order you want. you can gain as many levels as you want to make your play through easier or give yourself a level cap to make the final boss fights more difficult. i think this game gets better each time i play and the more hours i commit to it. ultimately, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes history, mythology, mysteries, likes to learn, dark souls/bloodborne/sekiro, and/or games where choices are important. i think if you want a game to put 1,000 hours into, this is a great choice.  i would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't want to commit at least 50 hours to it, dislikes the fantasy genre,  dislikes adjusting their playstyle to beat different enemies, shudders at the thought of being humbled, and likes to smash controllers and keyboards to express their frustration.
Greatsword supremacy
dog
Weird to say this game is addicting 
Very fun but hard af
10/10  RIP to all the Goats
It's a great game, but hard. Depending on how many other From Software games or other 'Souls-Like' titles you've played to get an idea of what you're up against. Keep in mind that the game expects you to of been through quite a bit over the time you play, as you have many options to get stronger through leveling or just experience playing. Both will make you stronger, not just one. But, of course, remember to level vigor.
Listen, I was skeptical when this first came out over a year ago. I unfortunately succumbed to all the negativity about how "hard" this game was. A family member finally talked me into it when it was on sale and I am PISSED that I missed out on buying this last year. Is it hard? Sure. But it is infinitely rewarding and you'll find yourself going back to the Lands Between as often as you can.  This game is beautiful, the combat mechanics are finely tuned, and the story is deep and rich. I've said enough, BUY THE GAME. NOW!
One of a kind experience.
It's honestly really fun! I don't know why I didn't play earlier! It's very fun and challenges you. There are a lot of opportunities to how you want to go about the game. Whether it be what skills you want for your class, or what weapon, gear, etc.. I would recommend this if you want something different than other games like this but allows variety.
P A I N
Lantern is very useful.
very fun if you can accept that dying a lot is intended. also expect to need to look up a guide (fextralife) for every questline
It's extremely well made and one of the best games in the past 10 years but sadly doesnt connect to me as much as dark souls does. Still an extremely well made game that everyone should try and a great introduction into "souls-type" games. thumbs up!
Awesome game! 195 hours and still playing!
I'm sure this game is pretty fun when it works--I trucked along until I was starting to get the hang of Margit--, but it stutters *a lot*; the various fixes suggested (disabling SMT, disabling e-cores) don't work on my AMD system; and the worst part is when it decides to randomly crash on fast-traveling, including using the "return to entrance" option after a boss fight.  Finally beating a boss only to lose all your progress is not fun.  Amazing that this ever got released, much less that it got a Game of the Year award.  I feel terrible because it was a gift, but I needed to post a fair warning to other players.
love this game
Best game ever.
Infinitely replayable!
A masterpiece 10/10
Whenever life feels difficult, I just remind myself that I beat Elden Ring and suddenly all those things don't seem like such a big deal.
fuckin great
insane
try finger. but hole
AMAZING!!!!!!!
greatest of all time fr
D:  
don don don
I have no words to say how great this game is, I truly believe that this is the best game to ever come out
Featured several rodents of unusual size, would buy again
praise the finger, but hole!
this games hard so im hard
much
behold, a review
W game
IM ADDICTED...
yes
One of the few games out there where it demands respect as Daddy, will pound your @#%$ into the Stone Age, leaving you bewildered and asking "thank you may I have another sir?!".
Great game, love it. I have more hours in it than any individual Souls game at this point and I'm still eager to play through on more characters. But you know why this game is good, so let me just say that it does have some flaws.  The biggest flaw imo is the repeated assets. While the world and enemies are still diverse overall, if you explore everything you will notice some similar mini-dungeons and repeat enemies (most notable is when you see the same side/mini-boss again). Did you think 3 asylum demons in dark souls was too many? Well now there are a dozen!  HOWEVER, even if this brings the game down a bit for you, you will probably still have a lot of fun with it.  ONE MORE THING. Please don't let anyone tell you how you are "supposed" to play the game. One of the best parts of Souls games is the diversity of tools available to you, and the ability to make the game as easy or difficult as you want depending on how you play it. So play in whatever way is the most fun to you.
Never thought I would love this game. Challenging but rewarding!
Thou are unfit, even to graft.
10/10 
D
This game is like all other Dark Souls games BUT it has an open world to traverse seamlessly in and everything works great!  Variety is there, countless build opportunities and fun with friends!
Fantastic game buy it now. 
Amazing game that keeps you entertained for hours!
It's beautiful, enthralling, and has interesting character building.... ruined by terrible gameplay and a control scheme chosen by having a toddler throw darts at a keyboard.  Ultimately, it is much more frustrating than fun.
The most approachable soulslike game. Challenge for those who want it and plenty of opportunities to make it easy for yourself.
Absolutely GOTY, combat, story and world building are phenomenal. Actually challenging at a lot of moments like all souls games but well worth all the pain. 5/5 stars.
This game is Zelda Breath of the Wild for adults!
so good very fun

It's got a great open world and challenging bosses. One of my favourite parts is the many build formats and how well designed the game is. You have multiple options to choose from, and they're all laid out for you depending on how much exploring of the world you do.
GOAT GAME GOAT CREATOR GOAT SERIES
I didn't play any Soulsborne games before Elden Ring. That has long since changed. Game made me cream on multiple occasions.
Wonderful Game
Praise the sun!
This is the best video game I've ever played. As someone who is brand new to the Souls franchise, I was terrified of this game and thought I wasn't skilled enough to play it. Was I wrong! What I love about this game is the fact that you get better as you play it. The graphics, story, combat and general gameplay is better than anything else I've played and once I finish it, I will be playing all Souls games, Sekiro and Bloodborne!
Great for solo play, and seamless coop mod fixes the multiplayer. I've played through 4 times. but I'm still finding new things
Play this game or you're fake
elden ring
Never played souls. this game is an awesome rpg.  
Good Game
Gotta say...first impression...sucks. Character creator broken on launch. First fight, Grafted Scion didn't spawn. Jumped off cliff, died and the game never reloaded....spinning spinning spinning. Uninstall and refund, wait for patches. Sorry. Wanted to like it. But unplayable after an hour...no go.
Pretty Wonderful game. I cant find much I have issue with. I suggest giving it a try even if you might not be into Dark Souls games or hard games in general, It is quite rewarding when you start to put things together.
game sucks wayy to much grinding just to kill first boss
10/10 masterpiece i cant buy this game enough times
Bloodborne 2 is pretty good
The game is genuinely great, A lot of people get stopped by the tree sentinel and try to beat him but just keep going on past him, Trust me on this.
RISE YE TARNISHED LFG!!!!! The beginning part of this game is one of the most amazing experiences. I would pay money to do it over again for the first time. I highly recommend this game.  The only thing is that it feels a bit worse towards the end, but I can't quite put my finger on why. Hope this helps people.  9.5/10. Highly recommend.
Elden Ring feels like an abuse relationship - it just beats you into submission and you keep coming back for more and more each time, yet you have no idea why. I had to put the game down for about a year, returned to it to beat it... and that is good enough for me (even with the tempting thought of new game+'s).   This was my first ever souls-like game and will probably be my last; that isn't to say the game isn't great. The world is massive, has detailed stories when you actually look for it, and the spells/weapon skills are fun to use. The game gives you a whole world to explore and gives you reasons to explore them (for example going into a random crypt that was completely option to give you a new item).   I highly recommend the game overall.
mediocore
ye
Excellent Game.
This game gives me hyper anxiety because I do not want to die, ever, but once I figured out that by over leveling and letting the summons fight for me it becomes easy my anxiety subsides. I recommend.
this is unfortunately the greatest game i have ever played
duuuuuuuude
i elded the ring
sending summon signs everywhere so i can get called in for some jolly coop is my favorite part, i learned how most of the bosses fight through helping other hosts get it done (i mainly play souls games for the online features)
great game
elden ringing
Chaotically good. Unforgiving and very challenging, but once you begin to understand how things work, it's one helluva experience.
awesome murder simulator - unfortunately you are the one being murdered as often as the one doing the murder.
its good 
Amazing
Definitely worth the hype. If you like any open world, fantasy, or rpg games this is great. Never played a Dark Souls game, but I probably will now. Doesn't need to be super hard either. I'm not great at it, but I've played a ton and still love it.
This is my first ever fromsoftware game! It took me by surprise at first, but i quickly got the hang of it. I love the open world and the story line of this game. 10/10 definitely recommend.
Good Game 10/10
"Try Finger"
No idea what this game was about tbh.  Story is spaghetti. Bosses are hard. Malenia is unfair. Hitboxes are questionable. Moonveil is OP. Ranni is my waifu.  10/10 would buy and play again.
Best game ever made
fockin gud yeah
I had 100 hours in Bloodborne and felt it was the best fromsoftware and souls-like game but after spending 130hrs in Elden Ring and 3 playthroughs im pretty comfortable to say that this game is the best game Fromsoftware ever released
You think you're tough for beating Elden Ring? Beat Dark souls 2 with only immolation then we'll talk
yes
G I T G U D  Before reviewing this game. Its a masterpiece.
This game is amazing.
Just when you think you won, the game will kick you in the face.... and you will say thank you, can i have another.
idk just play it its great
Amazing...everything!!!
Invokes the same amount of anger and cursing as all the older masterpiece souls games.
its really good, however very challenging. as a casual gamer who plays doom, ac odyssey, etc, this was a really refreshing game for me.
this game if f'n awesome..and hard af....  y cant bandai namco make dbz like this.. omg..
Very hard but very fun!
This game has a really helpful feature where every time you die the game will let you know by writing it in big red letters on your screen. That way you always know exactly what happened. It's such a helpful and user-friendly design decision.
great game i wanted dark souls 3 but since that game is abandoned now i can say that elden ring is a good game, the use of torrent is not great in my opinion, dark souls made you walk to all places even if you fast travel but torrent makes things easier which im not sure if that is a good thing
Best game?
i am elden lord

i was playing this while eating mc donalds my life was good until mc donalds dropped out of hand because i got scare by creep little man hump chair why do he do this. when my big mac fell out of hand i could not breathe was so upset because man hump chair. i so pissed off and my cat denis climbed onto desk and got scare by man hump chair and denis knocked over diet coke from mc donalds. i was so upset and sad. big mac was so yum got a few bites was tasty. then just when my life couldnt get worse while playing this game one of my friends friend pete came in with his big mac he threw it at me. but the throw didnt hit me it hit monitor causing monitor to fall and break my fingers. my nan saw i was playing this she was so mad so she dropkicked me into the wall and now family is mean to me because nana said it was my fault so now i am grounded. i then cried and got scare because denis drunk all diet coke from carpet he had heart attacked. i was crying so bad. but i ate big mac off floor it had dog hair in it but was yum tasted like big mac. why do he scare and make drop big mac. why he do this to me and family. i wish my friend raheem didnt gift me this game he caused me so much pain. but at least big mac supported me at the end of day. this game broke me but i will still play it because everything deserves second chance but if man hump chair make me drop mc donalds again i will not play again. i hope creators of this game dont have good birthday what the put me through no one should ever go through.

its a soulsborne allright. but it gets significantly easier on multiple playthroughs. i have several hundered hours on this game between pc and playstation. 10/10 would rage quit again
I'm not even really a souls guy but the last game that made me feel this way was Skyrim. The way there's literally always something just ahead to investigate. The way the reward for doing so isn't just a Korok seed or whatever (until it is, but then you read a note saying "Why is it always mushroom?" and it *feels* like you were rewarded, even when you weren't). The way every individual region of the world is just teeming with art direction and high fantasy imagery. The way the enemy designs are so interesting you flirt with death just to see the whole moveset. The high number of equipment items that all look genuinely unique.   One of the things that turned me off about souls games in the past was that if I lost my souls I felt like I had to grind back through an area I already completed to get them back or I'd be underleveled for the boss. I've never once had that feeling in Elden Ring. In part because the spawns are a bit more forgiving (directly in front of a boss room, for example), but also because of the fundamental gameplay design changes that come from it being open world. I'd go into it, but I'd rather get back to playing.  11/10 best open world game since Skyrim.
First Time playing a Dark Souls game. Loved it. Wish I could memory wipe my brain and play it all over again.

this game just never ends
Caters perfectly to the ADHD urge of running in the first direction you pick, which is how it easily took me about 50 hours before I fought/beat my first real boss. Love being able to just open the map and warp wherever I need, although I'd recommend using the pins on the map to figure out which dungeons you have/haven't done so you don't end up warping somewhere you can't warp out of without walking outside. Also good luck finding a lot of the NPCs to start/continue/end their questlines as some are very obvious whereas others are in the most ridiculous of places (looking at you Yura/Hyetta). Bring a friend along and get exploring!  My computer is below specs for the most part and so I was just glad it ran at all, I can deal with the frame stuttering, but I can understand how it'd frustrate others. Seems more stable now than it was at launch but that might just be me.
If your checking the reviews then get stop reading the reviews the reason most of these people ratted it negatively is either because they have ass pcs or the games too difficult for them its supposed to be difficult if it was easy then why play it
gaped my holes

10/10 would die again, and again.  Not even mad bruh

The fallen leaves tell a story.  The great Elden Ring was shattered.  In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.  Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,  and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.  Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.  The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.  A war from which no lord arose.  A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.  Arise now, ye Tarnished.  Ye dead, who yet live.  The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.  Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.  The ever-brilliant Goldmask.  Fia, the Deathbed Companion.  The loathsome Dung Eater.  And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.  And one other. Whom grace would again bless.  A Tarnished of no renown.  Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.  To stand before the Elden Ring.  And become the Elden Lord.

extremely enjoyable,  very hard but very good
Game is great but very time consuming do not play if you do not want long term commitment 
One of the best games of the last couple of years!
Death.
nice pot friend
good
After finishing a 70+ hour run where I region locked myself and 100%ed the game, only to have a power cut immediately after killing the final boss corrupting all my saves, I still want to dive straight back into another playthrough. Truly the game of all time
This game is pretty cool. i love souls-likes and fromsoft delivers again. If u like any DS game you'll love this. Sekiro/bloodborne u probably will. general RPG people interested in trying fromsoft, start here.
Top tier game. 12/10
Is good

Elden Ring, need i say more?
this game befits a crown
The best souls game yet. (idk about bloodborne, but that isn't out for PC)
Likely suffering

 Yes I would recommend this to others if they use the seamless coop addon.
THE ELDIN RING IS REAL 
Game good!
Masterpiece!
I will change this to a positive review as soon as i stop getting chinese players with 3+ second delay in PvP.  Make cross-region matchmaking work outside of japan, cmon.   Other than that the game is perfect
I kinda suck at playing game like this, but i appreciate the fact it does not hold your hand it doesn't force you to play a sure way. It literally said you chose this obstacle how will you beat it. The community phrase get good does apply buy remember if you get stuck their no shame in going somewhat else.
This game is amazing.  If you even slightly like Dark Souls, or have been interested in trying a souls style game, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this one.  Graphically beautiful and a really cool story.
Death is my beeeest frieeeeeeeend!
Paul Heyman would rather climb the edtree and tell a lie than stay on the ground and tell the truth. The truth is that this game is great, but the online is trash.
hard but very fun
Craziest game I've ever played
good 
Relaxing game!
It's not the perfect game, but it's amazing!
if you dont like the game cuz its tho hard thats known as a skill issue
good game if your pc can run it well, which mine cant. 11/10
The most accessible Souls game you can get today.
Pretty much my first Souls game, and the only actual open world I've played in a very long while  Insane balancing issues, some annoying level and quest design, fucked up parkour, clunky movement, some boring and repeated bosses... But god damn, I liked this game a lot My enjoyment came not from combat, but the exploration and character building It felt like everything I explored contributed to my strength, even though it didn't really  I only hit two walls: - Margit, because I was severely unprepared and unskilled - Malenia, counting 80 actual tries, the only time I broke my self imposed rules  I put some restrictions on my run a little after Margit: Solo, No summons, No consumables, No Rune Arcs, No guarding, Heavy affinity only Even so, the game felt easy with my heaviest armor / STR only / Colossal Sword build  Played the Grafted Sword for more than half of the game, and the other half was basically the Greatsword I wanted to try other weapons, but those felt like they were the best options I had for my build Smithing should have been more affordable to give room for experimentation  The story went right above my head, I have no idea what was going on I only knew I had to kill, and boy, did I kill Only character I grew attached to was Hewg, the blacksmith, who I liked a lot for reasons unbeknownst to me  Killed all the bosses and saw the Ranni and Fractured endings Failed most quests because wiki gaming sucks Great game despite everything  110 hours of play, 12 of them at Malenia :)
Highly recommended for people who have played souls-like games and want a challenge. I love the change of style with adding an open world concept to a souls game. Many bosses roam the Lands Between to really keep you interested. With the Seamless Coop mod, this just makes the game a whole lot more fun.

This game is absolutely amazing visually, Lore and story wise!!

Very easy game, got all achievements under 180 hours without any summons. This feels like a great tutorial for the other soulsborn games. When I want to do a zero-hit run for Dark souls 3, ( I dont own Dark souls 3) I boot up elden ring first and practise there with ease for my run in DS3. My favourite boss was Godfrey because he has a nice theme and was enjoyable to beat but still fair easy to beat also without being hit.  I recommend this game to players who are new to this genre.
good
Ive never seen a Souls game get picked up and put down faster than this blunder of a game in my entire life. Before you disagree with my review, just ask yourself, how long were you and your buddies talking about dark souls 3? How long did the internet rave about dark souls 3 with its content filling every platform there was. Now take a good look at this game? They made it a few months before it was out of the spotlight and forgotten about and that speaks volumes regardless of any other opinions or reviews.
One of the best game I've played

Beautiful and vast open world. After never have played a souls game, i now want to try the rest after playing this. Definitely recommend.
Game is Hype
solid indie game

I keep seeing a couch and white walls in the corner of my eyes. What's outside of the lands-between?
literally one of, if not the best game over made. it's a visual masterpiece, the gameplay's great! and the open world is amazing! you really feel immersed in the huge map.
good 
Great game. Playing on Steam deck.  Late game becomes frustratingly buggy  Biggest issue is controls desyncronise at worst possible moments. And more often than is reasonable.
Best Dark Souls ever
Its an openworld fromsoft game, thats the best way to describe it.

bro..
My first souls-like game that I thoroughly enjoyed and finished. Magic builds being finally properly viable was the game changer for me - and the possibilities offered by open world. Even though I hate games that frustrate me through nigh impassable and impossible obstacles, I enjoyed this from the very first until the last cutscene.
AWESOME!!!!
very good very niceeeee

One of the few games that actually surpassed the already enormous amount of hype it had on launch, and just kept getting better from there.  If you like the Soulsborne series you will love this game.
There is no requirement for a long review, save to say: THIS GAME IS THE QUINTESSENCE OF THE MEDIUM.  EXPLORE ITS DEPTHS AND YOU WILL NOT ONLY FIND AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE, YOU WILL REDISCOVER THE REASONS WHY YOU STILL PLAY VIDEO GAMES.    PS - This is the only FromSoft game I have ever rage quit. Had three months off and then came back.  Now it is my favourite.  Speaks for itself.
It is very fun

Finally I've gotten all achievements for Elden Ring!  Quite a journey this game is, started Christmas last year, and I finished it today.  Really worthy to be the game of the year 2022. The story, level and character progression, stage design, and most importantly the combat are all the best I have seen across platforms.  Definitely worth a try. A must play!
it fucks hard

game is great most likely the best game to ever grace the earth.
love it
This was a very disappointing game.  There was no direction in the game - I had no idea what the goal was.  After I googled several sites I found out I was to kill Godrick, or some such character.  That took hardly any time at all.  It almost looks like this is one of those early-release games as there are several areas that you cannot access.  That is not how this game was described before I spent (and wasted!) $60!  I have bought several other games through Steam and have always been very satisfied but this one not even close.
good game
Even if you're not thirsting for this type of game right now i'd say it'll take about 3-4 hours for you to get entirely hooked on the overall beauty that this game is. Would also like to note on the incredible level of refinements that the systems brought over from dark souls have gone through. Basically everything just feels good. very little frustration. Just enough to spur you on.
very good
This game may make you want to kill yourself but trust me. the satisfaction of killing some hard bosses is insane. almost like drugs if you ask me.
[b]Gameplay[/b]: Elden Ring offers a refreshing take on the action RPG genre with its open-world setting and unique boss mechanics. The game's combat system is fluid and satisfying, and the inclusion of summoning options adds an additional layer of depth.  [b]Pros[/b]: - Open-world setting provides a sense of exploration and discovery - Unique boss mechanics make each encounter feel fresh and challenging - Fluid and satisfying combat system - Summoning options add an additional layer of depth - High replayability thanks to the ability to experiment with different builds and weapons  [b]Cons[/b]: - Crafting system feels underdeveloped - Some areas of the game feel repetitive  [b]Overall Score[/b]: 9.7/10 
My first souls game, it was nice challenge!

So, I may not have a lot of time playing this game but from what I did play as well as what I've seen in game play videos, this game is awesome. Better than Call of Duty
It's very fun, for a masochist

w game 
I'm just going to go over gameplay and the world because I don't hold any opinions anywhere else.  This is first of all just a combat focused game, it's open world dark souls and it is what you would expect. There are no mini games, no towns, there's one little guild you run into and very rarely do you come across someone or something not hostile. Your traversal options are mostly being just grounded with the situational high jump being granted to you. You can't swim, fly, or glide. The game has A LOT of abilities and gear to collect, and it starts you off well with classes to go into and from there you can just start setting goals of what you want to tackle with guidance or experience. Playing blind can be a bit frustrating if you're exploring for rewards and not strictly for challenge because you may not find something that suits your class. The enemy variety is insane, there's also a lot of traps in this game inside dungeons, so check your surroundings. Also make sure you follow the tutorial all the way through to get the basics of the game unlocked, don't try to go gallivanting after you step out into the world, follow the light. The game has some balancing issues, magic is very strong, bleed is very strong. I never found much use for crafting, but I heard it's a bit helpful. The combat is sluggish compared to other action games and the enemy attacks are sometimes strangely fast and relentless as if they should be in Sekiro instead, trying to pick your moments with melee can be frustrating unless you use summons, which are also broken (especially mimic tear) because they distract the AI. Lastly, co-op in this game is a tragedy because people can invade you.  score: 7/10  Positives:  -Lots of enemy variety -Lots of skill and gear variety -PVP -Decent exploration  Cons:   -Forced PVP in co-op -Sluggish combat system -no variety in activities outside of combat and character building -very unbalanced combat builds.
its a good 9.5/10 very good yet hard.  "nine out of ten doctors recomend!"
It's all coming together now...
AMAZING
love it! 
The game of all time
Good game.
I hardly ever leave reviews but I had to give my take on this masterpiece. I didn't think it was possible to widen the appeal of the game to a larger audience while staying true to the FromSoft experience expected from long time fans. The mix of open world and the variety of combinations available to the player for character builds so far is unmatched by the rest of the series. Great enemy designs and tools available to the player. I see myself coming back to this game for a long time.
This generations Skyrim, But better. SO much better.
fun 
The char customization is weird, since you mostly can't see your face anyway, but okay. That the camera forces to be behind your char just feels awful all the time. I didn't play any Soul games before, so I#m def not used to the system. And I know it's supposed to be hard, but where am I supposed to get into the game while it jumps from enemies getting down after 3 hit, each impairing them, to enemies on horses there the horse kicks you into oblivion alone.  Speaking of fighting, sometimes the enemie goes for an attack, I try to dodge, 2/10 times it works, 8/10 it doesn't, why? IDK. You can't run, jump with F, and if you die you lose all your money, until you go back there to collect it, running into something that killed you.  Why do ppl like this game??
was good
fort, night

elden ring is elden mid it’s not a flawed masterpiece or a rough diamond or whatever else the meme 2 hour video essays tell you, it’s just mid DISCLAIMER: this is my second time playing this game, don't mind the hours, the first time i was doing the hand hook and eyepatch build  >open world probably the best aspect of this game by far, you just can never get tired of exploring the lands between one complaint about the open world i often hear is that you often find yourself just traveling way too much from point a to point b, but i don’t see this as a negative, since the game’s beauty alone is enough to keep your attention  legacy dungeons are also good but that’s been said a million times already  however, even this kind of open world is not without flaws  >copy paste why does this game have 5 or so dungeon types? no, i don’t want to explore yet another cave or a mine or some lazily copy pasted catacombs (sometimes with a chariot), but sometimes you have to, to get the smithing stones or that talisman you want but it’s not just the dungeons that get copy pasted, bosses and enemies do too can you imagine my disappointment when i got to the mountaintops of giants and was like "holy, this area is so beautiful, i wonder what kind of enemies i'll be fighting in here" can you imagine my face when i saw the caelid dogs, the caelid birds, the stormveil birds, the demi-humans, the bats, the marionettes, the hands, and the vulgar militiamen a-at least zamor dudes became a normal enemy instead of a m-mini-boss, so it's at least ONE unique enemy tied to this area, r-right? miyazaki, my brother in christ, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE ANNOYING BIRDS AND BATS AND DOGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, I’VE KILLED SO MANY OF THE DEFAULT SWORD/SPEAR SOLDIERS, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD MORE ENEMIES INTO THE GAME NO, YOU CAN’T JUST PASTE OLD ENEMIES FROM OLD GAMES, YOU DID THAT TWICE IN ELDEN RING ALREADY WITH ASYLUM DEMON AND CAPRA DEMON i am especially sick of the copy pasted dragons, erdtree avatars are at least fun to fight ROT DRAGON, ICE DRAGON, NORMAL DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON 2 ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME MOVESET this is a triple a game, just to remind you edit: there is way more copy paste from previous titles as it turns out, just today i found out about red wolf of radagon having the same animations as sif and the death blight frogs  >combat this is where things get bad, such outdated souls-tier combat where it feels like you’re handling a bus instead of a human SHOULD NOT EXIST with such fast bosses that feel like they come straight out of sekiro either make the player faster and give him more movement options, or make the bosses slower it is infuriating having to dodge 5-10 boss attacks only to get ONE hit in and then repeat the cycle torrent is awful to control, and it feels like he's not listening to half my commands wow, it's just like a real horse! the decision to make your stamina tied to torrent's is also bizarre and unexplainable also, input buffering is more often then not the result of your character’s demise, as it has been countless times that this trash read my ash of war as ash of war + left handed attack after it and i died so many times because of this before fromdrones shout “skill issue”, i am literally putting my hands off the keyboard after doing the ash of war and my character still does the normal attack after it but, despite that, my character drinks only 1 flask half the time despite me mashing the heal button i often miss the opportunity to reposte thanks to INPUT BUFFERING, so why not let the player know when the boss stagger is coming up? you're gonna make a posture break mechanic without implementing at least some kind of sign? i swear to christ miyazaki has never played his own games also, why do the enemies' arrows home in on you, yet the player's arrows don't home in on enemies? do the enemies have special magnet arrows or something? can some lore expert tell me how this is explained in the story?  >bosses and these bosses, oh god, these bosses delayed attacks, input reads (these are especially “fun” if you’re doing any run that involves projectiles), blatant destruction of established game mechanics, they got everything you don’t want in an action rpg and i can't stress enough how awful the input reads are, the best bosses for showcasing such nonsense are margit for his combo extender that he won't do unless you attack and the godskins who shoot black flames at you IMMEDIATELY upon pressing the heal button someone needs to teach miyazaki that's not how reaction time works but, being completely honest, i had fun fighting malenia sure, she is actually one to break established mechanics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Vbsr3Ko7M but at least that boss has a unique feel and dynamic to it, akin to an old samurai standoff, where the two warriors exchange blows and then fall back to circle around each other her attacks are more or less intuitive, and she does have a flexible moveset that’s fun to play around with on your part EXCEPT FOR WATERFOWL DANCE AND VAMPIRISM, WHOEVER DESIGNED THOSE INTO MALENIA NEEDS TO GET FIRED FROM THEIR JOB ASAP, AND UNLESS YOU’VE NOT DONE SOMETHING AS ELEMENTARY AS BEATING MALENIA ON A KEYBOARD WITH NO SUMMONS OR SLEEP POTS OR MOONVEIL/ROB, YOUR OPINION DOES NOT COUNT also, elden beast is the worst final boss in any video game ever, radagon was such a good conclusion to this mediocre, but still charming game, but nope, my face gets smeared with the broken unfun mess that is elden beast he's constantly running away, he's not at all dynamic like radagon, and he even looks like crap come on, who wants to fight a giant space spaghetti as the final boss? also, ulcerated tree spirit just ulcerated tree spirit  >story average fromsoft fan be like: OH MY SCIENCE IS THAT LE HECKING MIYAZAKI TELLING THE LORE OF THE GAME THROUGH ITEM DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 1488TH TIME??? HOLY GOSH OOOOOOOOOOO ELDEN RING seriously though, the lore of this game is admittedly pretty interesting, but the narrative sucks to give an example, in the beginning we are shown a literal powerpoint presentation about the world okay, what’s the night of the black knives? not gonna explain? oh, okay i’m a tarnished? i don’t even understand what that means what the hell is an elden ring? and so on and so forth stuff like this continues throughout the whole game because the narrative feels like a jumbled mess of in-universe terms and seemingly random events on that note, quest design in this game is unintuitive as hell to take varre’s quest for instance, how the hell am i supposed to know that i need invade other players THREE times to advance his quest? or patches, it’s like he’s teleporting around the map at random, he doesn’t tell you where he’s gonna go  >leveling softcaps? really? at least tell the player when they get to them, so he doesn’t have to google it i suggest this is due to pvp or some crap like that, but pvp is a portion of the game, not the entirety of it and you don’t balance stuff AROUND it the smithing stone grind in this game is obnoxious because of what i described about the caves in the open world section such game design is almost ubisoft-tier, and those are the items that actually get you through the game  >optimization it is just bad it is understandable why my fps are bad on medium settings, seeing distant lands is part of the charm of this game but the crashes are inexcusable i suspect it is due to the botched anti-cheat, since without steam this game didn't run half as bad  IN CONCLUSION i really cannot recommend this game if you're into the ACTION part of the ACTION RPGs it's a strong MAYBE if you're into the RPG part, but it's just simply so tiresome to even control your character this game is just outdated, through and through, and i think we all know why it won goty it is because there was nothing else better than elden ring i mean, come on, you're gonna give it to god of soy? miyazaki is a hack
try finger, but hole
Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!  Here are the ingredients you will need!  Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.  Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.  Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.   1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.  2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.  3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.  4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.  5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.  6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.  7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.  8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.  9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.  10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.
this game is very good
best game humans have ever made
it bad 
one of the hardest but best games ever
Seek Rump
bad ass game
git gud
Great game, If you liked Dark souls then this is a no brainer.
Skip the hard shit

The more I play the more I hate the game, all I can do is complain about this game. However I come crawling back so from software clearly did something right.
I love Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
THE GOOD:   * New open world setting. This works phenomenally, the change from the cramped and claustrophobic gauntlets in older Fromsoft titles to open plains in the Lands Between feels amazing. The freedom of engaging the world at your own pace is such a wonderful introduction. The areas introduced all feel unique with it's own stories to tell.   *A fantastic, intricate and engaging lore.  How can we describe the story and lore of Elden Ring? Well, I'd say Early Christianity, western alchemy, Gnosticism, occultism and mysticism. The historical foundation that serves as a base for the game's storytelling has been greatly expanded compared to earlier titles and is now bigger than ever. This makes this game such a joy to unravel, puzzling together the historical references.   *Stunning and unparalleled visuals This game offers some of the most stunning colors, weathers and atmospheres I've seen in a game. Each zone has it's own unique climate, flora and color palette that it nails perfectly. From the ever-clouded plains of Limgrave, the starry skies of Liurnia to the snowy mountaintop of the Giants.   THE BAD:  *The game sadly plays too much like an older Dark Souls game And what I mean by this, despite Elden Ring's adaptation to a more modern open world RPG, it still plays out like the titles of yore. It's a railroaded boss slaying game that offers very limited effects of player choices and world interactions. Many NPCs questlines feature interesting early stages that can be skipped altogether (Rogier, Ranni etc), without any punishment or loss of valuable items.  It makes the game feel extremely streamlined as it doesn't reward thorough gameplay more akin to a RPG.   *Limited weapon and armor variety  My favorite thing about Dark Souls 3 was the absolute variety of gear in the world.  Soldiers and knights in the Lands Between all carry more or less identical gear.  The pinhead knight armor having the same model across all factions is disappointing.  Not to mention they all wield the exact same weapons. The Brass Shield, the Lordsworn Straight- and Greatsword, Knight's Greatsword and Partisan. A world filled with different heritages and traditions should enable a more diverse selection of styles.   *Low enemy variety  This somewhat follows in the same track as the previous one, just as we see a lack of variety of gear on enemies, we also have a lack of variety when it comes to enemies.  What truly makes an area feel unique is it's denizens. Sadly, as we progress to the later stages of the game we can really notice how the enemy variety fizzles out, and in the final zones of the game we end up fighting more or less the same enemies we've fought before, but now they have a lot more HP, defense and attack. That's it.   *Unfinished and cut content  "First you should do when you're done writing, is rewriting"  Anyone who followed the initial announcement of Elden Ring probably expected what a rollercoaster the development process must've been. Ultimately, we ended up with a game worthy of the GOTY title, but in the end we can't help but notice how certain things feel missing or incomplete.  A cross comparison of item descriptions from the 1.00 version of the game reveals fundamentally different lore implications. A plethora of NPCs and questlines have been cut and reworked (Kale and the Great Caravan is one example), and we cannot know for sure what impact that might have had on the original vision of the game. Will these be reworked and reintroduced in expansions? Perhaps, but remember these were NPCs that were supposed to be in the base game (looking at you Rico).   THE VERDICT:  9/10  Elden Ring is without a doubt one of the best games of the decade. Maybe you think my criticism of the game are silly nitpicks, but for a game of this caliber and quality I do reserve myself the right of taking these observations.   Ultimately, Elden Ring is an epic unlike anything we've played before, it has truly set a new bar in the gaming industry.  All that I can ask from Fromsoft is to take some steps outside of their Dark Souls comfort zone in the future.

Tree-type bosses continue, to nobody's surprise, to be bad news.
Best game ever made
Elden Ring has the unique ability to completely immerse the player in its breathtaking world and well-crafted mechanics. Does its brutality make the player feel like they're walking barefoot on broken glass? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely.
This game best game, would sacrifice human life to replay blind
its no bloodborne
Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.  Elden Ring has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with Elden Ring. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I belive that it's each of the game's features: its combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc. that complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing and at the same time, come together in such a fluid manner that I as the player can't notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I haven't felt from any game before.  Other, more objective factors of Elden Ring are equally as impressive--it's hard to believe this is a $60 game. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. I have not had a single moment where I've felt the map felt desolate or empty, there was always something to see and explore. The combat system is rich, balanced, and rewards each playstyle. The difficulty of the game is refreshing and I feel that I'm being challenged to improve and innovate as I play the game instead of relying on old hacks. The subtle details, such as changes in behavior over time of day or cross-NPC interactions add a layer of immersion that makes the world feel alive. It is also a very polished product: while games today are released with game-breaking bugs and issues, I haven't encountered a single bug in Elden Ring even given its massive map aside from minor visual glitches. It is truly astounding how much that adds to the immersion of the game.  Overall, I feel that Elden Ring is an amazing game. While it isn't perfect by any means, in fact, the imperfections of the game give me something to look forward to for what will be the sequel to this, it will be hard to find a game from the last decade that is as immersive as this. I am truly impressed by From Software's work and I look forward to their next game. Elden Ring will inspire the next generation's set of games and I hope to see what comes from this. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Elden Ring and I hope to see you too enjoy it.
A truly vast and a visually impressive game.  No wonder it won game of the year. Fully recommend it.
truly one of the games of all time 
fucck me 
Games Horrible 
Easily one of the best games I've played in the last 10 years.
gud
I mean.... it's ALRIGHT....
Rings be eldening
Good
i played this a little as a test. if your reading this you already know your going to get the game. i also never recommend games to people. so stop asking please.
good
The best game ever made
Art
One of the best games I've ever played.
Amazing world design along with characters and bossfights. Interesting lore. This game has Miriel and Alexander in it so 10/10.
 great game, keep a physical quest log if you don't want to forget whats happening.
Great game. Lots of replay value. Definitely recommend it if you like the souls games.
Rise Tarnised !
I finished the game today, loved every second it. Beautiful game.
I enjoy personal torture :)
get good if you dont like dieing lmao
Fix ultra-wide support.  Get with the times.
Lots of positives with this game, completely wasted due to it's tedious combat. Extremely poor balance in interactions between the player and the A.I. To keep things short, it's never your turn in this game, and attacking in a neutral situation will get you punished 99% of the time. Where every other FS game standardises "attacking until it's time to dodge", this one is rather "sit around and dodge until you can throw out a single attack', Overall very boring and unrewarding combat that doesn't hold a candle to BB, Sekiro, or even Dark Souls 1.
just one more boss and then i'll go to bed
No
A classic which should be on every gamer's wishlist !
I LOVE PATCHES! I HOPE HE STOMPS MY BALLS REPEATEDLY UNTIL I FOAM TO THE MOUTH.
8/10 Great game, great story/lore. Playing it made me check out each main character's lore. Most side quest are enjoyable as well. No quest tracker, so you gotta have note those somewhere. Docked a point for how frustrating it is to play with keyboard and mouse. Target locking/tracking can be frustrating especially when trying to navigate around obstacles. Another point for limited rebinding keys. Acquiring specific targets can take some getting used to and frustrating
plump sort ahead
peak
i love this game with sex mods 
epic mythical open world
Strength-Build Mercs are the future.
gud
10/10
this game is truly the best game that from software have ever made its like the gift of the god brought to we tarnished gameplay 10/10 graphic 9/10 openworld 8/10 the feeling after u spent 2 hours on trying to beat malenia and u finally beat her 10000000000/10 and 100% the well deserved game of the year and the best game ever made in last 10 year
but hole
bloodstain... therefore no skill
Barely played the game. But it's good.
argh
This game is pretty good; I would sexy sex sex all the ladies in the game (yes even the old hags). The story is there (watch VaatiVidya). The gameplay is fun, it takes the best aspects of all the previous Souls games and combines them excellently. uhhh, Ranni, shes hot.
Top 5 games of all times for me
the game fun when you power level in the early game
-That's it, lads! Rock and Stone! -Did I hear a Rock and Stone? -Rock and Stone forevah! -We fight for Rock and Stone!
try finger but hole
very good game, most fleshed out in the souls series in terms of combat. the open world is a double edged sword, where in the old souls series the linear path made planning for ng+ simpler, in this game it can be quite daunting and all the questlines scattered makes it a headache without a quest log. many steps in the right direction, hope for tweaks in the next installment
Played this game on release in PS4. Had a lot of fun. Bought it again for PC, still a lot of fun.  The amalgamation of all the recent games From Software released.  Gave me hope that there will always be that one developer who will be consistently releasing good games.
Got hugged by a woman for the first time in my life
pizdec
No Elaboration Needed.
goty
I've died quite a lot in this game, and I still haven't beaten the first boss. Very fun.
Ranni
hours of fun and great multi play
Fucking Banger
Needs more poison swamps
its good
There is a reason that this game won GOTY
god like game
One of the best open world experiences. There are tons of areas to explore and a large variety of enemies to face. The game really shines early on but tends to stagnate near the end but the optional areas really carry it in the end. I would recommend the game to anyone who wants a challenge and suggest going through this game without a guide the first time. Exploring the world yourself is truly what makes this game special.
As a devotee of Skyrim Elder Scrolls this was an enticing game but very difficult to transition to.  Definitely worth the effort, persist and one will be rewarded by varied climate, scenarios and opponents.  Once you've mastered the controls the opponents, geography and gameplay become even more engaging.  Great game, worth sticking with it!!
If you've enjoyed any of the other From Stofware games just do yourself a favour. BUY IT
Genuinely amazing game, I've done several runs now of different types and I can't recommend enough. Good entry into souls-like games as players can sumount obstacles by overlevelling in the open world.
Mid, no rune of death.
What can I say that hasn't already been said about Elden Ring? 10/10
Never played a souls like game before. Surprised how much I liked it!
this is the most visually stunning game ive ever seen and has a story and excellent gameplay. 10/10
Very good
it's ok, i guess
Fun
[h1] Elden Ring is the pinnacle game in the Souls-like genre. Building on the foundations of previous FromSoftware titles, Elden Ring is a standout title and is the spiritual successor to Dark Souls. Elden Ring comes at a great time in a nosediving era of AAA gaming, and is the best new game I’ve played in a few years. [/h1]  Building on the shoulders of Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, Elden Ring seems to bring everything together into an all-encompassing epic which smashes the scale and complexity of previous titles out of the water. Thrust into a new high fantasy/dark fantasy setting, the player is put into a world which dwarfs the map size of previous titles; it’s full of more secrets and treasures than we’ve seen in other FromSoftware titles. Although some open areas are a bit dead, the quality of many of the game’s hubs is enough to overpower these “mile wide, inch deep” areas – including the great mage academy of Raya Lucaria, the game’s first castle in Stormveil Castle, the fiery peak which holds Volcano Manor, and the game’s central location which is the golden multi-leveled city of Leyndell. Of course, there is much more, with several vital, detailed locations spread out across a large world. You’ll find golden forests, caves full of crystals, icy fields and icy peaks, mighty castles, and great underground rivers. Speaking of underground areas, Elden Ring’s underground areas are less like dinky caves and are more like entire world spaces, complete with lost ancient cities, mighty bosses, and dark or mysterious secrets – for me, this may have been one of the most standout parts of Elden Ring. This is almost like if Zork was given the AAA budget it always needed.  Elden Ring has more quests and storylines than FromSoftware fans have ever seen, and it has several distinct endings. Elden Ring has a story that is fairly easier to interpret than past FromSoftware titles, yet I would argue it is also more open to interpretation in general, and has quest progression that is quite complex. Quests, especially main story quests, have several steps to follow, which may not always be stated explicitly. The game’s many endings each have different steps to achieving any specific ending, where these steps may run through different and separate areas of the world entirely – your only hints may be on an obscure item description, or just happening to find a NPC in the perfect specific place. When you consider this alongside the fact that a full playthrough of Elden Ring can easily take over 100 hours, it becomes clear that this game is intended for those who will truly explore every detail of the world. This game will require serious exploring, item description reading, and a deal of abstract thinking. You should know that there is no quest log at all, which only adds to the vagueness of quest progression.  In essence, the game is a massive riddle and puzzle – whether this is all a problem or not is up to you. It may mean missing out on entire quest lines and important characters or bosses, or it may mean finding secrets which few have found organically. This notable challenge is not helped by the game’s infamously harder-than-average combat – but, for me, if it’s not that hard then it’s not even worth playing.  Elden Ring is a darn difficult game to play through. A third-person fast-flowing M&M (magic and melee), Elden Ring’s combat system allows the player to dodge, evade, block, and counterattack in many ways, where each element must be timed very well – and, where small miscalculations can mean an easy end. While the game features some difficulty-reducing facets such as fast travel, a horse to ride on, and several opportunities to grind for skills, levels, and weapon upgrades, the bosses are still quite difficult to pass through, especially a few of the late game bosses. The fanbase may argue on who has the biggest stick among the FromSoftware games, but I kid you not – it’s far from a breeze. You must be on your toes at every second, and you must learn almost all of your enemy’s moves to persist and persevere. I thought Elden Ring’s late game was more hair-tugging than any of the other Souls-like games so far, and when it can be a 100 hour game you must steel yourself for far longer than your average game. This game is meant for people who desire a serious challenge, or at least is meant for those who can tolerate a serious challenge, although of course it can be cheesed if you so desire.  If you want to be pushed and shoved until you’re any good, and then still want to be pushed and shoved beyond that, this game is up your alley.  As a Dark Souls fan, it is time for me to admit that, deep down, I think Elden Ring is simply the better title now. Elden Ring’s quality has surpassed the older titles – there, I said it. In addition, I think this game is the best fantasy title in many years, and it has taken a jump beyond contemporary and established fantasy series.  If we’re looking a bit deeper into the storytelling and themes of Elden Ring, the concept of ambition appears frequently throughout the game, which could lead to one of many interpretations from the game: “life is what you make it”. While you could look at this for the very concept of “truth” itself, in my own subjective way I take it to mean “the world is my oyster”. A pinch of inspiration followed by a mountain of hard work may get us to the sea beyond the mountain, where our coveted oyster’s pearl lies. Ambition must be followed primarily by dedication, persistence, a Spartan’s courage, and a life of tough work to get to anywhere of meaning. While ambition alone is never enough, it is the dire lifeblood that builds empires, discovers worlds, and creates new kings. It is the very thing which underpins the motivations of Elden Ring’s characters, and which powers those of any value in the real world in front of us. For me, it is like a third lung or a second heart, while those without ambition are but a kite fluttering in the wind with its strings cut off – lost, without real direction, defeatist, and will remain in all flavors of mediocrity until they are dust in the wind.  “A man’s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  Still, this is just one interpretation of Elden Ring, when it may also seem there isn’t only one true interpretation from this game. From another philosophical perspective, I think Elden Ring may highlight a great point which is lost in many minds, especially within Western philosophy: there is not, or at least may not be, one universal truth or narrative, or at least that the concept of “universal truth” is subjective, with several coexisting “truths” or narratives happening at once. Some would probably pick this thought apart on the semantics of “is not” versus “may not be”, and moralists or objectivists would have a field day on the latter parts of that sentence, but frankly I don’t care. For me, Elden Ring mainly embodies these concepts within its several endings, as it may leave breadcrumbs but will never suggest any one truth or narrative for you. With what you may see later on in the game, you might see multiple truths and narratives taking place at the same time.  What is “truth”? What is “free”? Who decides what “truth” is? Who gets to rule? Who enforces “truth”? Who may be free? These are many of the questions posed by Elden Ring – questions which are not objectively answered and which are left to your own devices. The minds of FromSoftware and Westeros aficionado George R.R. Martin come together in a very interesting way, and offer several competing, separate philosophies to analyze.  [b] Elden Ring is the capstone project of FromSoftware, and is one of the few great AAA games in recent years. With more of Elden Ring still to come, it will be hard for a game like this to get beaten anytime soon, and it’s a great new addition to the fantasy genre. [/b]

MOD
Could this be dog?
better than sex
i play this game with: no summons, no magic, no bleed, no buffs, no armour, no dodge roll, no attacking, no breathing, and no sleeping. 10/10
One of the best games FromSoftware has ever made, it plays like Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 mixed together.  Has open world elements.
Great world building along with phenomenal boss fights. Every play through is different and doesn't seem to repeat itself
easy
gud
Greatest game since Ocarina of Time. Hands down. Not even close.   This game is more impressive than space travel.
It goochi 
Screw whatever sick and twisted part of the community keeps putting down "liar ahead" messages in front of solid walls
Goated
best game ive ever and will ever play
pain
rings goes brrr
Elden Ring is cool :)
pp
10/10
yes...
Good game, but the open world has its advantages and disadvantages.
I like it so much, I was just a filthy casual until I got serious about it. Then rage quit at Radon or whatever and have not been back since. But overall so great! I highly recommend
Time to die. But maybe less than before!
Large world, Great graphics, Great game play. FUN.
Bad, don't recommend
I mean yes, it's essentially a giant Dark Souls 3 with a horse and shields are actually fun to use now. But I played Dark Souls 3 until my Ps4 couldn't run it anymore, so it's a fine enough game.
Not my favorite Fromsoft game, but certainly the one I think is the most impressive. Area after area I was blown away by the art and level design. A truly great video game.
cant secs the lober ):
Best open word Combat RPG
Yes
dem fingers :3
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Excited for DLC!!!!!!!!!
9.5/10
adsf
Best game i ever played in my life, Made me feel like a 8 year old again playing my first game all over again. Knowing the unknown was always fun and this is by far the best story i ever played.
Hauntingly beautiful
Godskin Duo F*cking sucks Otherwise very good 10/10 life changing
Even with the power of almost god hood in your hands, souls of monsters that you killed yourself answering your bell call like a butler, being able to crush demi-gods after a couple of tries, killing dragons, the stuff of fantasy and 4 floors tall monsters with a big stick or a big iron stick, memorizing and beating the ever living or death of things beyond normal understanding, and the main story line of the game is family drama and the main plot is you getting no Maidens, through out the entire thing.  20/10 game! Recommended.
Beware Tarnished
yea good shit
Quite probably the greatest game of our generation. Definitely the peak of FromSoft's work so far.  Come to the Lands Between! There's all sorts of activities! Ride a horse! Pet some dogs! Get shot with a ballista! Eat crap with a total sociopath! Get hitched! Burn down a massive religious icon! Kill God, and nearly all of God's incestuous kids! Learn about the sheer existential terror of the stars! Help your friends kill God! Kill your friends and their friends, too!  Seriously, it's good. If you're one of the 4 people who hasn't played this game yet, take the opportunity and leave those other three losers in the dust.
awesome
Maidenless + tarnished
post elden ring depression worthy
very coul 
This game will be remembered, it's a masterpiece. I could never get into souls games before this, but with Elden Ring it finally clicked, this game is amazing, it's so good I had 300 hours and multiple characters on PS5, and I just bought a Steam Deck to play it on the go.   If you're curious at all about this game, try it.
this game is perfect. i would 100% reccomend
best game I've ever played
i loved this once you get used to the patterns you do really good
Praise the Elden Ring!
Thank you Mr Miyazaki
old circle
good dog
great game
Damn.
112 hours and I haven't even beaten the game. I've just now gotten to Deeproot Depths and still have the city to explore and the Giant area. This game can be as long or as short as you want it to be. The action is what you've come to expect out of FromSoftware but with a particular polish that makes it more accessible to a more mainstream audience while still holding on to the "get gud" mentality. So many ways to build your character, and even if you're not big on replayability, there's always PvP and DLC! The world feels immersive, almost uncomfortably so at times and the music adds to that ambience (I'm always looking over my shoulder playing this game, feeling like someone might sneak up on me, that's how much it grabs you). 4.5/5
Hit things with sticks and look at the pretty places.
This game made me feel like a got my anus torn apart and than sewed together. Cant wait for the dlc to unsew it.       Definitely recommend.
I’m no a hardcore gamer, but this game is addictive. I haven’t played any of the games I have purchased on Steam for this long of a period. Last souls game I played was the original PS3 Demon Souls (hated it, the difficulty and frustration, sold it or  broke the disc in halves then threw away). But this game is a keeper for me. The intensity, the difficulty, the sense of power when defeating a boss in combat, the gameplay, all worthwhile in this game. My first review on Steam.
Great! Now give us Bloodborne
Best Souls Game
Played the game in two-player coop using the Seamless Coop mod, had some bugs but it was fun.
The fallen leaves tell a story.

Elden Ring is a masterpiece
playing this game is like sitting on my balls, i love it.
It says something when you can have no idea what's going on and are terrible at the game and still having a good time.
great game 
this game is really really amazing. this game make me review a game for first time . thanks from software for creating this game . hopefully theres another more game like this in the future
Best fucking game I've played in a long time and I've been gaming for over 26 years
The culmination of decades of game design, Elden Ring stands above all previous Souls titles in breadth and feel. A masterpiece that really makes you wonder what wonder of a game such a team can put out next. For now, the patient wait for the first DLC.
Wonderful vast world to explore, fun and unique build options, outstanding graphics, and extremely re-playable.
Im peter Griffin
ds3 betta
super good
FUCK
BLOODY HARD
ez game ngl
My alice wonderland for me to be honest. The graphic and lore is a brilliant combination creating a great atmosphere of “Lands Between”. NPC are alive, they have their own purpose, their journey. And our choices will affect them in this way or  other ways.
forever maidenless pepehands
Amazing game, so amazing in fact that its the first i ever got 100% achievements for. A breath of fresh air in the current gaming ecosystem.    Also SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE LETS GOOOOOO
Thank you Torrent.
Game pissed me off but damn it I had a good time

I simp for Ranni, good game tho
Best game of its genre (ie. Skyrim, etc.)
It's been almost one year since I finish this and whenever I think about the game I feel like starting it all over.  Such an incredible experience.
This game is simply amazing!
best
Amazing game
masterpiece recommend  
i wanna tear ranni's bandages off with my teeth
fire game
perfect
yes any play style works dont limit your self to the 1 way you played the other souls game for once STR isnt the only option
It's a great game, you've seen it everywhere else, no need to abuse a dead horse.   Highly recommend you check out Seamless Multiplayer mod on Nexus if you wanna play the whole game with somebody.  The constantly summoning in a friend at a point of interest gets very tiring.
tak 
Honestly the perfect souls game. I was skeptical about mixing the dark souls genre with open world , but it just works. In fact it works perfectly and add in all the RPG elements from leveling , gearing, and other additional systems along with the combat and you have a deep game with plenty of exploration. The game is massive you'll never be bored playing it and leveling is just fun while the combat is challenging / rewarding. Also you can JUMP which is huge in a fromsoftware game. Anyways just buy the game you will not regret it easily worth it full price too.
this game forces you to be good, i like that
this game kicks my ass, I love it, for sure playing again! the open world is absolutely the best ever made in my opinion, absolutely thrilled by the dnager lurking in every corner.
Some dude with DID
Great Game.
too hard of a game, not fun.
literally just everything is good idk
amazing game on pc and on steam deck aswell
The best souls game for me by far. I've played every single souls game since DS1 but this game takes the crown for me. I've heard a lot of people have an issue with the lore and what not but I'm the opposite, I think the lore is great and the setting is what does it for me. I think this game is going to be either an S tier or an A+ tier for you depending on how much you like this style of game. The game is a souls like game but with a heavy emphasis on "open world", which IMO is amazing and there should be more of this. I'm a big enjoyer of these open world games so for me it was an easy S tier maybe even S+ with the DLC when it comes out. Most people who criticize this game are used to the classic souls like experience where you just follow a set guideline and stay on it, meanwhile this game throws that out of the water and lets you go anywhere you want whenever you want. I already beat the game once just rushing through it and even then it was extremely fun. The game has lots of replay ability and some people have even 10+ replays, every time you discover something new and different than your previous play-through. Right now I'm doing my 100% play-through, meaning I discover and do every single thing the game, get every single weapon, talisman, etc. I think this is the way to go in terms of playing the game and brings the most out of it, very fun game and definitely recommend it even for the somewhat steep $60.
My early review of this game is awesome.
Another goated game by FromSoftware. Common W.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a title and a beautiful journey from beginning to end
I gotta finish this game.  I didn't get stuck, I just got burnt out. I had a ton of fun, But the game is sort of 2 play-throughs of dark souls glued together, and I'm halfway through the (effectively) second play-through like... meh
10/10 even better with seamless coop mod also 'NO MAIDNESS??'

Fajne to je
One of the absolute best games ever created. After 100 hours I can attest that without a doubt it is both time and money well spent. The community is fantastic and the honor/code within the game keeps players coming back for more within the multiplayer spectrum. For Sure, a must have.
doing this instead of writing my essays for uni 
One of the best games I've ever played, plain and simple.
only after you've done everything can you touch grass
Tearing my heart out, but a good game 
Got gud. 10/10
use a controller or forget about it
Good game
good! 
Greatest Game of All Time
Arise now, ye Tarnished Ye dead, who yet live The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.
Ver good game will continue playing for other ending
You either get OP build with bleed or you suffer because end game enemies deal more damage than bosses
it defiantly takes some time to get the hang of it but it is a fun game
Honestly the greatest game I have ever played and its not even close.  I can't wait to pour hundreds if not thousands of hours into this game. I've completed the story and killed all bosses and somehow is still find a ton of things to do. Not to mention that I already know I'm going to play the game over many, many times. This is a perfect game for ME for many reasons. Instant pre-ordering the DLC.
Beware the poop eater to your right.
I'm not even a massive souls like games player but this game is beyond incredible - if you haven't played a souls-like game before and are thinking of trying it please just go ahead because you wont be disappointed.
game is very good its really fun and extremely addicting i am so excited for the dlc cause i will use up another month of my life
yes
gud game 
Me like
got boring after the 14 playthroug
Game is designed for consoles. If you do not like to play with a controller, i do not recommend this game.

I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Elden Ring and in less than a week, he had already played for over 28 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
killer
good game
super easy 
Boss bar go brrrrr
I really tried to like it, but it has to be the worst gaming experience I have ever had.
Game of the Year  10/10 Graphics : 10 Audio : 10 Game play : 10 Story : 10 Game Time : Endless 10/10 Optimization : Running perfect at 5800X and 6800XT  The only annoying thing is the recycling of opponents.  
An extremely entertaining game with beautiful views. What really sets this game apart, makes it S-tier, is the open world design. It's perfection. You'll be traversing this awe-inspiring landscape, and something will catch your eye. Sometimes it's a distant structure, other times it's a ray of light through a cliff wall, or a cave. Nearly every time. if you take a moment to explore what caught your attention, you'll be reward with a hidden path, dungeon, material, or at the very least another player's message. Open world games should all take a lesson from Elden Ring.
The best game ever made
1.Come back from work/school 2.Play elden ring 3.Try kill a boss or great enemy 4.Die 5.Alt+f4 the game 6.Go to sleep 7.Wake up and find out about a feature or op item from youtube 8.Be excited to play after work/school  Rinse and repeat until you either beat he game or uninstall...
THE game
EZ
Dope game but the Malenia was too easy to beat (I died 157 times)
Alright folks, this is Donald Trump here, and I want to talk about Elden Ring. Now let me tell you, this game is tremendous, okay? It's like nothing you've ever seen before.  First off, the graphics are beautiful. The colors are so vibrant, it's almost like you're really there. And the gameplay, it's phenomenal. You're fighting dragons, battling evil monsters, and exploring vast landscapes. It's like the Wild West of video games.  Let me just say, the creator of this game, Hidetaka Miyazaki, he's a genius. He's created something truly special here. And the music, it's fantastic. You'll feel like you're in the middle of a movie with the way the score builds and falls.  Now, I know some people might be hesitant to try this game because it's a little bit hardcore. But trust me, if you give it a chance, you won't regret it. Don't listen to those fake news critics who say it's too hard, they just don't have what it takes to conquer Elden Ring.  In conclusion, Elden Ring is a winner. It's a game for winners, okay? If you're looking for an adventure that will test your skills, then look no further. So go out and get yourself a copy, you won't be disappointed.
Oh my lord so goood!!!
i hate you morgott
This is how open world games should be like
dog
Dark Souls, Bloodborne and The Witcher 3 all in one, great fun.
Fuck the sewers 0/10
Amazing souls game even if your not really into this genre (like me), really worth the money spent

In lands of wonder and magic fair, Elden Ring awaits, a marvel rare. With sunlit fields and noble beasts, Thou shalt embark on thy journey's feast.  Yet danger lurks at every bend, Foes to challenge thee until the end. But with weapons and skills to hand, Thou shalt emerge victorious and stand.  The story of heroes and villains told, Memorable characters, tales unfold. Triumphs and tragedies, all shall see, A journey most wondrous, bound to be.  And when at last the quest is done, A sense of satisfaction, second to none. Elden Ring, a jewel of gaming lore, A treasure to cherish forevermore.

Amazing game. Best of the souls-like.  But for co-op I'd recommend the Seamless Co-op.
Potato Head
I like to suffer
If you ever wanted to get into souls type games, this is the perfect game to start
play this game, so fun and relaxing
absolutely phenomenal game. definitely one of the best, if not the best game ive ever played. i think this is the closest to a perfect game experience anyone can play right now
Nervous System Destruction Simulator. 10/10
Masterpiece
i keep getting fingerblasted by every boss
BUY IT!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No need to say more. Game of the year.
nice farming simulator x50 for sweaters
.
amazing
Balls absolutely shattered, unlike my table ye scrubs
Great game
gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Taco Bell
game good
good game but it does not hold your hand at all so keep that in mind
One of the best game what I ever played!
i'm not elden lord, i'm happy to be ranni loyal consort :)
Masterpiece  truly a masterpiece  worthy of game of the year  Better than hollow knight
I played this game for 600 hours on a broken, choppy, and messy PS4 and considered it one of my favorite games of all time. I think playing it in more than 30 FPS, minimal bugs, no crashes, and on high settings made me realize just how much beauty i was truly missing out on, and im only 25 hours in on my first replay. Easily my favorite game in the last 10 years, maybe even ever. Nothing comes even close to how much I love this game.
The lands between looks amazing, the graphics is great, the gameplay is challenging, I just wished there is a quest panel like the others RPG, I feel lost with the quest but I don't mind, its great to explore, the open world reminds me of oblivion, there is a surprise on every corner.
A great experience. Massive map and items to discover. Deep lore for diving into the world of the Lands Between. Exciting gameplay experience. A Must-play game!
one of my all time favourites
a
Overall a great game of course, but experienced soured quite a bit during later parts. So currently I am not in the mood for getting other endings, expansions or other From Soft games. While sites of grace are more generously placed than in Dark Souls from what I remember, I still got annoyed the times I had to run more than 2 minutes and re-instate all buffs over and over and over again for some bosses. Meagre loot combined with the rune loss mechanics is not fun. Don't really ever again want to fight another Crucible Knight, Maliketh, Radagon or Elden Beast. Besides that, the game is just too long. I recorded 140 hours and then I still skipped some chunks of the map entirely. With that out of my system, the only fair grade for Elden Ring is a, perhaps weak, 5/5. It's eased up enough to motivate even me, a non-fan of From Soft games, to keep going. Expecting this to have a big influence on many future games.
outstanding graphics
good game
A Game that is not handed to you. The game awards Adventurers in their truest nature! There are mods on nexus to make it multiplayer if need without interruptions, but respect the game's servers if you shall mod it or else you may no longer be a tarnished, but a banished in its truest nature..
Really liked the open world and the versatility of fighting options
Try finger But hole
gut
this literally is the best game on steam i own i spent 100 hours alone just exploring and i know for a fact im still yet to see some of the world
death everywhere
Must buy
Quite literally the best soulsborne game I have ever played. And I should know, I've been playin' them all since Demon Souls.  This title combines the best of the best when it comes to the amount of choices of play, and is probably the best place for someone to start with the series due to the game being open world, enabling players who are stuck with one thing to go to another and eventually slowly learn as they go. And for returning players, they'll find familiar weapons and mechanics, plus all new ones leading into some really interesting styles of play.   My only complaint with this game: Due to the game being open world like it is, it is rather difficult to continue and very easy to completely miss some NPC quests and stories. The game is still completely enjoyable without doing them all, of course, as this is the kind of game that encourages players to play it multiple times to really experience what the game has to offer, and if you're really desperate then you can always consult a guide online these days.  I highly recommend this game, and consider it in the realms of 10/10. Great music, beautiful awe-inspiring environments, wild creature and character design, an absolute ludicrous level of freedom. If you must play a singular souls game in your life time, this is the one I recommend. And that's just the base game alone, we'll see just how much better this game is when the dlc arrives! This game is well worth the base price, but I understand if you'd rather wait for a sale. Just be sure to give it a go!
Its cool beans
frustrating but good. power through!

Just spent $60 on a game that I cannot even play with my friend because it doesn't support cross-platform. Don't really care though because the game is still fun as ****.
I mean... It's alright
Great game.
best game ever
play it
amazing game but lacks at many places 
It's ok
Awesome game beautiful scenery lots of different playstyles
This game takes over your life. Not recommended if you are currently living. 700 hours in and still finding new ways to come back and sink at least 20 more hours into this singularity of a video game.
A masterpiece as far as im concerned, evolution of the souls genre with the new open world aspect. Every corner you go to there is pretty much something to be discovered, perfect game to come out in the middle of all the greedy cash grab releases to show that these games still work today and there will always be a market for games like this.
awesome
Really, I thought I was gonna hate it, now I'm strung out on it.
Before this game, there was no light, before this game, there was no water, before this game, there was no food, before this game, there was no life, then from software graced the earth with oceans and rivers, graced the earth with meals and food, graced the earth with life and vibrant joy, thank you from software for making this game and creating all good in the world.
I have not played any souls-like games over the years, but this one was created to be accessible to pretty much anyone while retaining the From Software difficulty, truly their magnum opus thus far.
its pretty good
This game changed my life.  I went from someone who had never played Elden Ring to someone who had, in fact, played Elden Ring.  5/7 would recommend
yes
AOE Bananza
Git gud
this game is absolute dog water, i requested a refund but they refuse to give it to me.
amazing game so many play styles to try if you say the game is to hard farm some ruins and lvl up and it makes the game easy and fun
Brother Ham, careful with this one. You won't be able to beat it.

A very addictive and mostly fun game ... YET ... it is also a frustrating time-sink.  This is a PvE-single-player-explore-and-conquer dream.  But I don't recommend it.  It is frustratingly difficult at times.  The story is non-existent.  There are no quest guides to help you navigate the open world.  I am playing the game with a 12900k + 4090 yet it frequently stutters during combat, even though it's weirdly locked to 60 FPS.  My 2017 7700k + 1080 Ti could do 4k60 so ... what gives?  This game feels a lot like Elder Scrolls games: sure there's a main questline / goal but you can totally ignore it and just wander around and do stuff.  I never finished Oblivion or Skyrim; I wandered around, leveled up, did some quest lines, joined some guilds, then got bored and stopped playing altogether.  Elden Ring has been similar ... I'm 160+ hours in and have leveled a lot and explored but now feel fatigue & boredom.  Since there's no story development, I don't feel any connection to the world and the characters in it ... why do I even care about becoming the Elden Lord and stopping the baddies in this world?  Since there are no quest markers, I often find NPCs dead (as evidenced by them being a pile of lootable armor) having missed meeting them at the correct time.  But, I usually just shrug at this because the game doesn't give me a reason to care.  Will I come back to this at some point and play more?  Absolutely.  And, if you choose to buy this game, I'm sure you'll enjoy it at some level ... just understand what you're getting into.
A souls game with no equal. It is the everything and the everywhere. The best of the best if you are ready to bang your head against the brick wall and get to the otherside. The story is good (if hard to find), the music is amazing, and the visuals are the best it's ever been in a souls game (with the exception of bloodborn maybe). Play the way you want with more builds then any of the others in the mainline series and have fun dying. NOW, if you don't know if you like souls games I would say this is an amazingly solid first step. RISE YE TARNISHED!
W
Awesome game, not for the lore, but the gameplay style. You can use so many different weapons and methods against different enemies and bosses, even more so than Dark Souls from what I've seen of it. Really deserved Game of the Year in 2022!
This garbage  is so overrated
Great game play that will give you a challenge while also giving you memorable battles.
its great just get it bruv
this game is one of, maybe the best game that played in a long time. the beauty and the atmosphere plus the gameplay make this game a 10/10 in my opinion. I hope that the dlc is as fun and pretty. I only wish that i could replay the game for the first time.
dodge simulator
Good, but gave me anger Issues
mad fun
Beautiful
500 hours in and I still wanna play it.
pain. so much pain
The best souls like game that FromSoft have released to date. Really enjoying the game so far, the horse makes all the difference in the gaming experience. The open world is enjoyable while not being too hard to navigate. i would recommend buying, you won't regret the purchase.
Don’t be scared off by the difficulty, it’s hard yes especially if you charge at everything head first like an idiot, it’s open world so you can run away and get stronger and work your way into it. If your struggling in try changing up play style to something that works, don’t get caught thinking you need to fight a certain way to win. Overall great game, just never give up, and memorize those patterns.
Banger
The controls are hateful, might be better with a controller but the key board isn't good. I am a lefty and always have to remap for how I play, I can't make this tolerable.  I have about two hours into it and I won't try again.  Blown money, should have spent it at the bar.....
Top 5 games of all time
Beat the game idiot
really fun 
If you were gonna play it you'd have played it. Had a blast playthrough one, fell off playthrough two, probably wont be a playthrough three. I miss bloodborne
My desk has a hole.
good game
This is a must have game, the developers respect the players intelligence, it does not "hold" your hands to reach other places, the battles are hard, however you can always grind to level up or save that gruesome boss for later, the soundtrack is spectacular, the lore incredible, this is definitely the GOTY of 2022
try finger
"try finger but hole" - Ashen One
10/10 amazing game   
i'd put an elden ring on this games finger
great game not for people with short tempers this game is very hard and you will die a lot but once you get the hang of it its a very fun game with lots of things to do
It's just good.
Elden ring is like a mayo and jelly sandwich, jelly is the sweet feeling you get from killing a boss mayo is the stuff that comes out after you kill a boss
I got to touch a women
Takes the concept of Souls and upgrades it with an enjoyable open world + storytelling. Beyond amazing and def worth every single bit of praise it gets
I honestly think the game was good, until the artificial difficulty set in. Is it not bullshit to be doing very good on a run to the point that you can't see red on the bosses health bar, and then all of a sudden it starts spamming every single attack it has not giving you a fucking second to react? I think it's the definition of bullshit. On the elden beast it does this thing where it shoots stars from the sky that track you and it's very annoying, and how i've gotten past that on every single play-through i've done is by running, that's what your supposed to do. But that doesn't matter. Because every single time i get it down to super low health it won't even let me avoid the attack anymore. i've been stuck on elden beast for 5 hours and without fail this only happens when it gets to low health, every other time i can get past it easy no sweat. I thought the game was great but having the end game boss have an attack that tracks you and basically kills you in one hit if it catches you unavoidable is borderline cheating.
You love pain? This is the game for you!
bad game, not game of the year cuz of catacombs. good game wouldn't include rabid black blade dog, waiting on elden ring 2
PEAK RING
pretty best
y
game is hard
Got the game on day 1 and loved it since. (its a Goty winner so you know its good) if you're interested in this game and never played a soulsbourne then its a great opener into the genre with it not being impossible beyond belief and with a good learning curve as you progress. it has the same base formula as the rest of the soulsbourne games but with it being open-world its quite a big jump from the others so if you have a chance play the others but find the lack of open world unappealing i hope you can at least give them a chance preferably bloodbourne. (but that's me being biased heh :T) anyways its a beautiful game so give it a go and if you're still unsure after seeing the mountain of positive reviews go check the million videos of the gameplay. 1000% worth the money
i suck at it but its fun
I've never enjoyed grind, but this is somehow different. I can casually play this which I appreciate. It's hard but rewarding. Runs pretty well on my seven year old Dell G& 7588 laptop (GTX 1060)
the best game created after bo3
its pain but i cant stop playing it
God tier game. Nothing else to say. Enjoy!
its got maidens
My first FromSoftware game. Amazing. Haven't felt this kind of experience since Skyrim released. I am also playing with mouse and keyboard. While I have not explored magic use (which will add more control complexity) I am doing great with only a few changes to keybinds.
this game is so shit i die to every single boss like a hundred times and the catacombs are filled with small rock shits and don't even get me started on the sewers in lyndell royal capital filled with the dumb omens who spew shit and piss 10/10
shits fire
goated

Very nice game and all but why do I have to install a mod for 144Hz? It's 2023 now and 60 FPS feel like SloMo to my eyes...

Just as fun the second time around!

It's a gruelling grind.  You either love that and do it, or you fast-level (see YouTube for how) and making the difficulty feel more balanced.
You can tell exactly when and where the devs stopped being able to find new ways to make the game fun and challenging instead of just unfair
one of the best and just an awesome game to experience and play. Yes it will hurt but you can try and mitigate it by exploring the world or coming back to bosses later, but it will hurt.Just buy the game
10/10
100% on Xbox. Now to do the same here.
One of the best ever

A true culmination of the souls borne games; I can't get enough of this masterpiece of art. Bloodborne was my favorite souls borne game, but Elden Ring has stolen my heart.
neat
its stunning and amazingly challenging.
you dont have the right, O' you don't have the right therefore, you dont have the right, O' you don't have the right
Lives up to the hype if you like Soulslikes.
Could not configure right mouse to move forward, refund.
Not online. Barely functional connections, that don't last and are abruptly halted by the game. Can't even open a door together. Pretty poor.
The best souls game ever made period. Would gladly die defending this statement.
Gud
my headphones are in pieces, my mouse replaced, screen cracked, keyboard broken, and multiple monitors are also broken but yeah i'd say it's a pretty fun game
game good much make me cry long time
Yes.
i guess its okay... little addicting but so is heroin so whatever
I mean, it got GOTY for a reason Goat game 800 hrs between all platforms i still like DS3 more tho ;)
If there is one thing that I have learned from this game, it has to be that her name is Malenia, and she is the blade of Miquella.
ELDEN RING. Need i say more?
Elden Ring, Its not just a game but a circulation of broken controllers tarnished bonding, Joy and accomplishment. Its not a game for the faint of heart or for those without the desire for overcoming greater odds. A one of a kind game that will echo down the halls of souls born glory as a beckoning to a new age of what is and what was.
I'm playing the game with the seamless co-op mod. I would not recommend this game to anyone wishing to play with friends without this mod.   That being said, this is definitly the game of the year, and ive got little to no complaint on the gameplay.  9/10 overall experience
Unable to play during release as the microstutters made dodging impossible. Game was completely unplayable once combat started with any boss. Thankfully the microstutters were resolved in a patch and the game is now playable.  Very enjoyable and would definitely recommend for anyone that enjoys Souls games. The transition to open world worried me, but was alleviated once I experienced it and saw how it plays out.
very fun
This game is to DS3, what DS2 is to the first instalment: one step forward, three step backwards. The pvp is worse, pve is worse, the lore is worse, the network issues are worse (how you managed to mess it up three times in a row?), recycled content and leftovers from DS3. Overall just overhyped and unfinished, what is left feels uninspired and boring compared to what the rest of the franchise has to offer, it looks pretty tho.
topp
good
An incredible open world that begs to be explored and quite frankly redefines the entire genre. A captivating (albeit sometimes vague) story filled with politics, betrayals, and fated destiny. Truly my favorite game of recent memory and up there with any all time great. A sincere love letter to gamers looking for that long lost sense of wonder and adventure in today's market.   Truthfully, a masterpiece. Rise tarnished, and claim THE ELDEN RING.
Hmm🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔, good!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is one of the games you must play, especially if you've never played a "Souls Game" before. It will be hard at first, probably damn near impossible. Invite other players (ghosts) to help you and learn what the good ones do to win a fight. Craft stronger weapons. Get the armor that will help you the most for the fight. And practice your dodge rolls/parry/blocking. You WILL  get better, even if it's slow, until even you can join us in burning the false prophet, the tree, to the ground.   Praise the Sun \o/
good game, but harder than my dick at 3 am
Tarnished, a word. I heard you conspired with Ranni the Witch. I understand. The need for puppet gush is strong. Do you think I've not felt it? In my quest to be all knowing, I too have known the draw to the blue cunny. With 'er four arms, think of all the things that she could do to it- your tarnished tackle. And then imagine ten more. Just tell me this: When she was miniature and in your grasp, did ye... stick 'er in a jar? And did ye fill that jar with your tarnished seed? I'd do the same if given the chance. Be on your way then. To the capital.
Very easy game with an understandable plot that draws you in!  :P  <seriously though - it is a GREAT game!>
.
its alright
I'm only 9.6 hours into the game and I have so much left to discover. This world is full of adventure!
The perfect challenge
it sucks. better play ds2!
Super fun. Soulsborn perfected.

Very cool game i like 
ELDEN RING  I wanted to be objective on this review so I left it for some while and waited for my excitement to go down. Fromsoftware and their games are my favourites. I love Souls-Borne series the most of all games. I started with Dark Souls 2 and after it played through Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro. DS1 and Demon Souls I saw on the live stream.  Then I played an absurd amount of souls-like games from other studios or indie developers, for example: Surge 1+2, Hellpoint, Lords of the Fallen, Nioh 1+2, Ashen, Mortal Shell, Salt and Sanctuary, Code Vein, Thymesia, Death's Gambit etc. The point is I love the souls like formula in the games and all these games that I mentioned are great but I wanted something fresh, because all of these game follows the same pattern.  When Elden Ring was first announced I thought of it as no big deal, but man was I wrong.  Elden Ring took the souls formula and pushed it to another level - open world. It could sound terrifying but it isn't, trust me. The masters from Fromsoftware did absolutely amazing job in implementing all that we like into an open world. The world is full of activities, enemies, bosses, items (every one item except consumables has its own specific place), NPCs and stories and full of amazing lore that we love. The game challenges you at every corner and I thought not even once that I'm bored. Worlds on Ubisoft "checklist" basis are nothing compared to the world of Elden Ring.  Build variety is as amazing, maybe better than in Dark Souls. Main dungeons are sweet and complex locations like in the previous games. Side dungeons are okey, sometimes they look similar to each other, but it depend on "biome" in which you currently are. There are lot of secret tombs and theres questline for witch Ranni, that opens a whole area of the map that you cannot find otherway. Skills, spells, weapons feel epic and adds a lot of flavour to your playthrough.  It's a fresh wind for souls games and I hope the coming DLC would be even better than the main storyline.  Pros and cons: + Amazing open world + It feels like Dark Souls but better + Graphics are slightly better but nothing big, so I felt like home from the beggining + Epic bosses, even better than in previous games (I mean main bosses) + Great lore and exploration  - It's not ideal for a newbies to souls games  For me Elden Ring is 10/10 game, that will have a place in my heart for eternity.
best game I have played, second only to Gex
Very nice
Elden Ring is one of the first Souls-Like games to really capture the feeling while changing the formula.   The ability to jump with Torrent and other mechanic changes somehow make you still feel like you are in a souls game while adding fun and challenge.
Had some stuttering issues at launch, and it's still not the most optimized title From has ever put out, but that's to be expected of Japanese dev PC ports.   Peaks a little early in my opinion, the first half of the game feels like a true adventure with challenging difficulty and new content around every corner, but once you reach the halfway point, some of the content starts to feel a bit stale and a bit easy if you're using all the tools the game gives you.  That being said, it's a fantastic game, and probably the most complete/polished game From has ever put out.  9/10.
Greatest game of all time!
What a masterpiece here! A must-must-must-must-play game of the decade
wish i could erase my memory of this game so i could experience it for the first time again. fromsoftware just does not miss
This is how games should be. No battlepass, no game store, no lootboxes, no politics. Just a fun game. I'm tired of playing games that shove more shit in my face to buy, I just wanna play games and have fun.
Banger.
As my good friend Mc Pasta once said; "They went hard"
Its a great game 1000000000000000000000 out of 10
Hogwarts legacy was too easy and I thought I needed a challenge. This game does not under deliver in that category. Best game I've played in years.
When I was in my lowest lows there was a lot of hype surrounding ELDEN RING's release, so me being a meat rider I decided to buy it, and it was the best meat riding I have ever done.   The game was pretty fun I'd say. Some highlights of my many playthroughs were Ranni, my feelings of hatred towards Commander Niall, the satisfaction of flawlessly doing a no hit run on Radagon and Immediately almost dying to the space worm god, playing space song slowed and reverb while looking at the Academy of Raya Lucaria, and most importantly putting the ring on Ranni's finger. All great times. So uh yeah.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that ELDEN RING gave me head, and it was awesome... And so my friends, with all that said can we all agree that the true ELDEN RING is the friends we made along the way?

big swords
Insane game
good game
ITS HARD AF!!! LIKE MY DICK!!!
A year later and this game is still a masterpiece!! If you have never played a Soulsborne game before, this is the game to start with! It's not as difficult as the others, but still provides amazing boss battles, a lot of class customizations and play styles, as well as a really good story and deep lore. You won't get handfed the story, so you'll have to listen to all NPC, read the mini stories on weapons and gear, but in the end you will love it! And if you start now, you'll be ready for the new expansion that they announced, Shadow of the Erdtree! Rise, Tarnished!!
FromSoftware is not for me, but I keep buying because of the hype and keep getting disappointed by what makes this such an award-winning experience: It's damn hard (no, really); Even the terrain hates you; Nothing is linear and Google is your friend; Story? I'll tell you bits and pieces and you figure the rest out yourself someday, if ever. Graphics? AAA (How many A's can you put here?) Music? Lots of A's Creature design? I'm running out of A's Enemy variety? You have more enemies than you did in highschool. 
I want dlc where you get to receive baldachin's blessing from Blaidd
gam gud
"Even if it does violate... The Golden Order."  These are some of the first words you will hear in Elden Ring. It plants a mystery in your mind that persists until the very end. I knew right then that this game was something beyond special.  Elden Ring is a difficult game, especially for new-comers like me, who are new to the Souls-series of games, but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step I took. The environments, the bosses, the silent storytelling of the world around me was so.. unique. The more I played, the more I wanted to know, and I fell deep down the rabbit hole of this game's world.  I will never forget the cinematic landscapes you see for each new area, the distant castle walls or giant golden trees. It is truly something you need to experience.  The gameplay itself is quick and tight, the bosses pose interesting challenges that respect your time. Slaying a boss, especially the ones in the main story, feels like you really did something substantial, as often the world changes around you in their absence.  You are only ever given one goal in Elden Ring that truly matters.  Become the Elden Lord, no matter the cost.
This deserved game of the year
It's too good, I literally can't stop. Help.
best game since skyrim
What is the holy crap. Why do people like this? Maybe the most clunky combat I've played since 1995. For reals, horrible character creation, it's impossible to make a character that doesn't look like their face is smashed inwardly, There are no round edges on models or terrain so it's like I'm playing with polygon shaped graphics like I did in the original Tomb Raider on my PS1.  Zero direction, zero story... I played for a hour and requested a refund.
good game
Brave Tarnished... Thy strength befits a crown.
ok
Probably the best game out there!  If you play a different char , the game feels like a new game all over again.
Yes very good, good bonking good magic good world. good
Best game.
Maidenless :headcrab:
I can't run the game but still bought it
good game
Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay
It's fun! 
Vision of something incredible. Ahh, it's like a dream...
yes 
great game. super frustrating but the feeling youre in a different world untouched by the lore of other fantasy titles is amazing. its entirely its own hellscape nightmare adventure. worth every scream towards the heavens in anger.
Malenia will make you question your existence and leave you with an acute redhead phobia.  What´s not to like?  10/10.
gut
wow. just wow.
noice more of that please :)
meh
Pain
play this game
I liked the part when Mohg the Lord of Blood says "IT'S MOHGIN TIME" then Mohged all of over me. It was honestly one of the most other-worldly, fantastical experiences I have ever had hands down. It left me absolutely bewildered and gave me a greater appreciation for those robot ladies from Atomic Heart.
If you like having fun and explore this is the game for you just beware you might lose some gaming equipment.
nice
Gane good
I can't f* stand this s*
game is only 50 gigabyte cause they copy-pasted almost everything at least 1 time, every dungeon looks the exact same and even has the same mobs.  its nice to have alot of bosses but maybe they should have made them more interactive and make the animations as big as the hitbox. the last 2 bosses were probably the worst thing i fought in any game ever  very clunky combat system, the animation of not having pots left to drink stuns for about 3 seconds and cant be canceled. about 90 % of the time enemy hits cancel your attack and sometimes your own hits cc for 3 seconds and there seems to be no pattern, putting on 3x better gear against cc didnt make any difference either.  the game is not that bad, offers a lot of content for not too much money but if you play it keep one thing in mind: YOU CAN SKIP BOSSES. some bosses have such poor designs or hitboxes, they dont deserve to die. If you want to just run through i recommend strenght build, its about 50% better than any other build and doesnt even get outscaled in late game despite only leveling vigor and strenght    
I always missed something in zelda breath of the wild. Dungeons that have cool boss fights and more enemy/ boss variation. Elden ring provided excatly what i felt was missing in botw. So if you like topnotch exploration, cool dungeons,spicy variation of enemy/bosses and mindblowing boss fights definitely check out Eldenring. One of the best souls games to this date!!!

In my opinion one of the best games released in the past decade, easiest thumbs up ever! Love the combat and exploring the open world, the great variety of weapons and builds you can play with,compared to other souls games it's more straight forward with less maze-like places which is personal preference but i personally find it appealing.
Amazing game; looking forward to the expansion.
Not dark souls IV, but still good.
glid mi as hecc tu dlc many goodest geim
TRY FINGER BUT HOLE
aint no dam way
Entire gameplay loop is: walk around, appreciate how pretty it is, unless you're in a swamp find some new horror or horror finds you it beats the shit out of you for 2 hours maybe you beat it maybe not move on and feel hollow either way boring af tbh  Serious issues with the pacing of this game. Feel extremely under levelled the entire time I got how the levelling is supposed to work but the time it takes to go up a single level esp if you want to use strong things that need like 30 in half the stats means you're clearly not meant to be grinding the same enemies to get there because the only farm able enemies give like 11 runes so the only option is fight and win against whatever is the strongest thing you can find is and half the time you have no idea if its worth it you slam your head against this giant whatever for half an hour or more, finally get it and all it gives you is some crafting ingredient and 1k runes, what is point in trying after you get that meaning the entire game is just getting pummelled by the next OP boss that just shits on you in 0.3 seconds very. fun.
Best RPG, Loads of fun.
Game of the year for a good reason.
Best game.
In the end, you, are still maidenless... 100% would recommend!
i love this game so glad it won game of the year 
best souls game ever
At first place no clue what are you doing and dying alot but if you get to playing you can actually enjoy it.

Don't you want to get lost in a world with infinite possibilites while also being mentally horrified by some of the monster variations only to end up slaughtering them all and becoming the lord of all that lives or is yet to live
BEST SOULS GAME!!
First time souls player, one of the best games I've ever played.
Want to waste hours of your life in a cruel yet beautiful world, then this game is for you
skill issue
The dogs can go fuck themselves. Otherwise game is pretty good.
Exploring the world has been one of the best experiences in gaming and the game it's 100% worth it just for that. The combat is starting to feel a little stale after all this years and I would like seeing some improvements in that regard in the future. The bosses felt like a bit of a step down compared to Sekiro.
ranni my beloved <3
spent 5 hours on 2nd boss 10/10
awesome bulby like
duh da best 
THE ELDEN RING!!! THE ELDEN RING IS REAAAALLL!
What's there to say?  Good game is good.
Love it asff needa play more, dont have enought time
Incredible game. I love it. Stellar art, really enjoy combat, and the amount of variety in build you can do always keeps it fresh. I love this game
Ranni
the day after i 100%ed the game they announced dlc  i thought i was out, i thought i was allowed to have a life again, but no.
ohhh
incredibly overrated but still pretty fun
A sluggish and nonintuitive snorefest with visuals so dreary that you're sooner rather than later going to find yourself staring longingly down the now empty anti-depressant bottle.
A game worthy of my frustration.   
GIT GUD
game fun, will die
Praise the crab!
Masterpiece
Arise now, ye tarnished. Arise now, in the middle of the night to try that boss battle one more time
dark souls 3 superior pvp
its preddy good
They did not lie! This Ring is Elden  Ridiculously fun gameplay loop, and one of the most immersive experiences I've had in a while... I'm astounded by how lively and intriguing even just the first area is, and I still have so much more to see!
very kool game would reccomend to the suicidal
try finger
Exquisite.
good game
Best game i have ever played on steam this shit is fucking awesome
This game was born for Asian people
poopy shit
best game ever prolly
ez game
Very good tbh it's fun once you understand how to do shit
From Demon's Souls to Elden Ring, I've played every Fromsoft game and this one is a gem. It's the culmination of everything Miyazaki has learned. Bits of every other game can be found from the jump attacks of Sekiro to the aggressiveness of Bloodborne with how some bosses react to whether you dodge forward or backward. This is, in my opinion, the best Fromsoft game. Not my favorite, that would be bloodborne and Sekiro, but definitely the best I think.
It got game of the year for a reason.
10-10
Good enough.
I could play the role of Maiden UwU
fun
Can they stop making open worlds so f**cking massive, just have a decent story please. Overall good game though.
I mean...what can I say? It's epic beyond reason. Wish there was a true multiplayer without mods, and also wish people didn't take PvP so seriously.
Thank you Miyazaki! Great Product! Yet another line up to the souls series!!! Thanks to my friend Zulfiqur for the gift! Love you queen!! xoxo
get it
Rough but fair. Anything is achievable and doable. Don't show maidenless behavior.
Friends said if there are 300 likes and 100 awards on this review, they will buy a case of beer, guys help out !!!
Jesus christ.
gud gaem 
cool
Totally forgot to review this game. This game was fucking amazing I love the lore and the art. I could get lost just looking around and staring up at the erd tree. So excited for the dlc!
Actual Perfection
ELDEN RING is the best game of 2022 in my opinion I have played this game for 200 hours and still find more things to do. It is insane how much content is in this game. The combat is fluid, good and the build variety is insane.  I have not even tried all the builds in this game. The boss's are some of the best in any video game I have ever seen and are very memorable. Any gamer should give this game a shot but the only issue on PC is some fps drops in certain areas but never in boss fights it does not bother me that much. In conclusion this is a masterpiece of are generation. I am very thankful this game exists because I have never seen this much ambition to make such a wonderful game and being in fresh air as it is a different game then most AAA titles. If you don't give up on your journey through the lands of between it would be a unforgettable gaming experience.
I expect this to be the best game I play in my life. Truly cant imagine anything topping it for an inconceivable number of reasons. An absolute masterpiece.
I was hesitant to try a souls game because of the difficulty. Idk how the others are, but this one is very fun. I'm really loving the open world to explore and this game definitely has more variety compared to other games which makes exploring a lot of fun.
its a decent game
the bomb
THE game of all time.
Makes you want to slit your wrists :) 10/10 will play again
Really hard game but when you beat that one boss mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! It feels so good!
Best Game I've ever played!
very good game! excited for dlc
Mommy Melania
It's everything that FromSoftware has learned culminated into a near perfect Open World RPG.
i love everything about this game, the lore,the combat, the monsters.  The pure rage it gives me when i get killed over and over and over......   :) i love it.
Dude just play it.  It's literally the damn GOAT.
I'm living in that 21st century Doing something mean to it Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it I guess every superhero need his theme music No one man should have all that power The clock's ticking, I just count the hours Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power (21st-century schizoid man) The system broken, and the school's closed, the prisons open We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'fucka, we rollin' Huh?

(21st-century schizoid man)
excellent game.
the game that was with me in my bad times, connecting me back to life
Step into the lands between if you like open world games that do not hold your hand. In fact, this game goes out of the way to make you doubt every character and set piece. They will both kill you, if given a chance, with no mercy nor hesitation.
im stuck at lamp head

This game made me cry in an amazing and terrible way........

This game will eat you and spit you out into a toilet. 10/10
graet game.
This is one of the games where I will look back in life and think, that was a damn good game.   I will also be reminded of the difficulty it brought as I sit down at my desk and see the indentations from where I beat the hell out of it out of sheer frustration. Thanks Dragonlord Placiduxax and Elden Beast.  It is epic in every sense, 10/10.
I LOVE THIS GAME INCREDIBLE IN EVERY WAY!
One of the best games of all time. 10/10
Easily one of my top 10 games of all time

Good game.
this game is awesome. its my first real "souls" game. played sekiro which offers a fairly linear path however this does not. i originally didnt like the idea of very little guidance or direction but after 10 hours and many deaths later you get the hang of it. i recommend this game to anyone. it is well deserving of the many rewards it has received. i cannot wait for the dlc.
no maidens ?
it aint allat  
new users should try  finger, but hole
help me im addicted
Awesome game, nothing to complain about.
What can I say? It's just fucking good.
infuriating game.
yes.  great first souls game
好き
praise the dog
One of the best soulsborn games, big map many bosses, many thinks to do. Worth money.
Hard for Newbies but addicting
9.5/10  Only downside is that quest guides are necessary and the games too big. Some say this is good but to avoid burnout I recommend limiting your exploration.

This game continues to kick my teeth in in ways that Dark Souls 1-3 never did, but I love it anyway.

The only regret that I made is I waited a year before purchasing this game. Don't make the same mistake as me. It is worth your ka-ching!
Write a review for ELDEN RING
Thow art of passing skill. Warrior blood must truly flow through thy veins, Tarnished.
I loved this game. By far my game of the year. I loved it so much that I beat it 10 times. Getting all of the items on separate runs can be hard or leave you wondering how to go about it, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This game is musically diverse, and the overall visual appeal is incredible as well. Many games hold your hand, and this game does not. However, it was notably easier than other Souls games for me, and the leveling system with the open world was very enjoyable.
smelly ring (caelid addition)
Very good game, it can be overwhelming at first especially if you are going in blind. But id say about 2-3 hours in that feeling goes away as you figure out where to go. It could benefit from being slightly more linear in some parts of the game. A good 8/10 closer to a 9 than a 7.
This game is a broken mess. No skill required. Just click at hit the sponge.
Great game hard and fun.
one of the best games out there!
good 
It's ok
commit arson
this is a game you should play before you die
Insane game
foul tanished buy this game right fucking now and you will find thy maidens fast
Peak game
Great game with challenging game play but tons to explore!
I died so much I started liking it.... 10/10
its gut
This game told me I'm maidenless. Best game ever.
Insane game (better than the witcher 3)
dog
Best Game since Witcher 3
When you finally put these foolish ambitions to rest always feels really good
Beautiful
If you like this game play Bloodborne, or if you don like this game then go play Bloodborne and than come back to this game.
made by Satan himself but if he had a doctoret in art
I've never died so much in a game before and liked it. Please help me. My life has no meaning anymore. What is life? What is death? This game allowed me to welcome death with open arms. You will soon embrace death yourself.
Not completely sold on it at this point, but its ok
i died 420 times... nice 
After playing this game (About 6-7 story bosses in so far) on a blind play through with little to no help from any wiki or such this is potentially my favorite PvE game of all time taking the place of borderlands 2. Nowadays we don't get games like this often and I feel like anyone who hasnt played this game is missing out big time.
This game hard

It's Elden Ring.
I bought Elden Ring shortly after it came out because I missed playing some souls-like, and man was I blown away by how beautiful and well made the game is.   And HUGE. Oh my... is the map huge. There's just always more and more and more even when you think you've seen it all.   The addition of horseback riding has definitely been a nice new thing that I know a lot of players are liking. (though I didn't really mind walking in previous games) I also think spells are probably better and makes more sense now than they have in the past in FromSoftware games. Which is good cause I always found spellcasting to be pretty weird in their games.  The world and its colours are absolutely stunningly beautiful, the bossfights are epic and fun and you have a massive arsenal of weapons and armor to choose from, with 'Ashes of War' to add new abilities.   Overall with how well made the world is and how much effort you can feel has been put into it I would call Elden Ring a masterpiece and I'll give it like a 9.5/10   The only downside I have with the game is stuff like quests are still so vague and weird like I think they have always been in FromSoftware soulslike games which is a bit ugh for me and some of my friends. But I know it's kind of in their style at this point. It is just not very appealing in my opinion.  But you can always just focus on the main storyline in the game and you will still have plenty of stuff to do in this huge world. :)
It's one of the best, if not the best, open world games i have ever played. The feeling after finally defeating a boss thats been massacring the ever living shit out of you is so rewarding.
"Become one with the tumbleweed tarnished"
greatest game of all time
best open world i have experienced, recommend even for people new too the souls series
Its 2023 and devs of a AAA game still don't know how to make a PC recognize and show the UI of a controller.    No doubt game's a masterpiece, but one would assume that after shitting millions devs would give a shit when it comes to game optimization.   Fix the issue after a year of release? Nah, keep it as is. Much better.
beautiful game so far i've really enjoyed it
yeah

well deserved GOTY
As a souls vet, I have loved the series since Demon Souls.  To have an open world was always a want. and the introduction of magik definitely increased the challenge level. love the game
better than the trash Sony makes
Fun
Love this game! It has everything I could ask for, probably the next best game to get me this hooked after skyrim! Hell! better than Skyrim!
mive
It's pretty good.
Do I recommend this game? of course i’m gonna pass all my days saying this shit it’s worthy of the goty and how much I love from software
smash
Incredible Game and Stunning Visuals. Because of my trash PC it lags a bit but not enough to hinder any kind of gameplay. Also it seems that they will soon release a DLC for the game and I can't wait for it. Graphics: 10/10 Difficulty: 7/10 (Not impossibly difficult but still is quite a challenge) Weapons: 9/10 Armor: 5/10 (Wish there were more badass armor but that's alright) Sounds/Music/Voice Acting: 10/10 All in all, incredible game as usual. Can't wait for, not just this upcoming DLC, but all upcoming DLC's to drop.
Step one, wake up, step 2 get rekt by tree sentinel, step 3 die untill you complete the game and step 4 is feeling empty because you wont die asmuch in other games and those games feel easy now.
good game
Excellent open world RPG. Elden Ring is my first Fromsoft/Souls game and boy was it a trip, to sum it up although difficult it was very rewarding. This game is just art, pure plain and simple art. Its actually astonishing the amount of content they were able to fit into this game (one playthrough can take 40-60 hours) which is well above the industry standard (due to Elden Ring's success it might be setting the new one). Because of my experience was I definitely envision myself playing through the other souls games but not before I go back and replay the game as a wretch just for that extra challenge and because the game is so expansive that I actually didn't even get to do everything I wanted to do on my first playthrough. If you are looking for a new open world fantasy rpg game to absolutely immerse yourself in for a minimum of 50 hours this is your game.
Runs well despite my pc being 3-4 years old, amazing feel to the combat, beautiful graphics, and a very engaging story
Radagon can mend my Elden Ring
I wish there was an average rating on steam. Great world to explore, level design is top notch, but the gameplay is just very bad. I don't really get all the hype about this game, its just an average AAA game

Better Call Souls
As a professional tarnished player, who was born maiden less , and still finding maiden. I felt it too personal to my life. So it was like playing myself in a game, too real.  Ez glep for me.

Try parrying though.
Awesome game. Seriously
Yesmdtuhdi id yudn i like it yes
I seek love and Fia gave me.
the malikai worden boss was too hard
awsome game  
elden ring.
Beautiful in a dark sort of way with supremely satisfying (and terribly difficult) gameplay. Everything you have heard about it is true, except for that one person who said it's "too hard".
This is the video game that makes me love video games again. Elden Ring is everything I ever wanted in a game. It's big. It's beautiful. And more importantly than everything else, it's a game that respects my time and money as an adult. It doesn't try to force me to spend money on needless microtransactions. It respects my time with a seamless open world full of mysteries, wonders, and treasures.  If you were holding off on playing this game because you heard it was hard, just know that Elden Ring is the most accessible soulslike game ever. There are mechanics built into the game to make it an easier experience, because everyone should experience this game.
Somehow finished the last couple bosses without summoning randoms.
Best game I have ever played and has set the standard for open world RPGs. And now we even get DLC, hype
it is a game from trusted, quality company FromSoftware. its not blizzard, it is not EAsports you know you are paying for the game you will enjoy. whatever the cost quality of this company is always better than price to pay for it
My first souls but appears to be a peak souls of accessibility for high difficulty or easy pickings being both encouraged. If you are the ladder, there's an npc outside the spawn that says to go to the castle first. Don't, unless you want a frustrating first experience in the genre.
👍
BEST GAME EVER
It is a very hard game but very fun. And very prety
best story game i ever played
Best game ever(of course its lie)
Patches
Open world dark souls where you can choose which ways you want to suffer. Hot girls and bloodshed; who could ask for a better game. Just remember the only way up is down because you will die. Sometimes you won't understand why you died, other times you know why you died but can't accept it. So just go in and die. Then go back in and die again, and yes, you will die again ... and again ... and again ... until you realized that after all those deaths that you suffered through. You somehow reached the end point ... and you die again until you complete it. Welcome to Souls like games. Get it. Great story and visuals with soundtracks to make you feel like everything is on the line until you forget to hear it because you're fuming from the last couple hundred deaths from that one boss standing in your way. 10/10 would recommend and would play again
I died
...
I mean what can you say that hasn't already been said, this game is incredible. Challenging and fun as can be.
hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard hard  also hard hard hard hard hard
Blue woman me like, me like game. Game good, woman good.
Came because I like feet. Also, came because I like feet.
This game has literally limitless possibilities. Most fun i've had with a game in a long time.
nice 
A massive open world that feels alive and interesting to explore. There is always something new around every corner and  there are areas that you can miss entirely in your playthrough if you don't pay attention. And I think that's really cool, makes the exploration all the more rewarding, unlike in many other open world games where everything is handed to the player on a silver plate.  No micro transactions or any other kind of crap. This is how it's done. (Looking at you Ubisoft..) 
Try fingers but hole
It’s pretty good.
Finally beat the tutorial.
I am Malenia, blade of Miquella
The game is sick! Great fights, great landscapes and you can get lost in doing what ever you feel like.
ez peezy
worth the pain
good
.
it a nice game overall but not for og soul like games i prefer this for new player (people who didn't play soul like games in general)
Game very good.
Rise, Tarnished.  Claim the Elden Ring.  Become Elden Lord.
Game of the Year
better than drake
Best game, somehow I sucked myself into doing a second play through without New Game Plus. Just a straight up second character going with a Faith/Dex build rather than Str/End. Needless to say, this game is amazing. One of the best RPGs to ever be made. While some boss encounters are definitely bs, all the important ones are really well designed. The game, while not forgiving in combat, has tons of options to help players get ahead and grind away the difficulty of the game. Don't gatekeep yourself from looking at guides either. There is so much to do, so much fun to be had.
TLDR: This is my favorite game of all time, and I think you should try it. :)  (Below includes a few details like mechanics, but does not mention any spoilers for major events, locations, or characters)   [Gameplay]  - Freedom of choice - Choice in Elden Ring is abundant. The game begins with the ability to select a class, each including different armor, weapons, and starting stats. Picking any one of these DOES NOT lock you into a specific playstyle for the rest of the game, they merely give you your choice of starting gear to begin your journey. As you progress, you will be able to find and equip different armor pieces, weapons/combinations of weapons, skills that can be applied to most weapons, and spells/incantations. Despite these being the basics of defense and offense, there are many other ways you can play that include things like sneaking, a flask you can mix ingredients into that have many varying effects, craftable temporary throwing weapons, horseback combat, spirits you can summon into battle, and many more. Most importantly to me, you can use your environment to your advantage such as destroying explosives, knocking enemies off ledges, ambushing, etc. Choice may also be applied to how you finish the game, as there are multiple ending you can achieve in wildly different ways. Some of these endings are straightforward and easy to find, while others I know for a fact I would never have found if I didn't hear about them. Being an open world game, it becomes obvious that you have multiple paths that you can go at any given moment, but Elden Ring does it very well. MOST OF THIS GAME is content that isn't needed to finish the story, and there are entire locations that are hidden off the beaten path with ZERO indication of their existence.  - Difficulty - It's no secret that this game is difficult. I have played multiple games made by this developer that are just as infamous for their difficulty, and I still had a hard time getting through it. If difficulty is something you don't enjoy, then this might not be the game for you, but I suggest you at least finish reading the rest of this segment. Difficulty in this game does not vary with an "Easy, Medium, or Hard" set of modes, but instead, the difficulty comes from choice and circumstance. The playstyle you choose may make some parts of the game more difficult and some more easy. I found that in order to make the game easier or harder comes purely from how you limit yourself. The multiplayer mechanics of this game can mean that you don't have to lift a finger to win this game. Doing a challenge run where you limit yourself in specific ways can make it a run that isn't humanly possible. If you feel that the game isn't hard enough, then you can subtract certain elements of the game to make it a more challenging and fulfilling game. Another thing that makes the game more difficult is after beating the game. When you finish the game, you have the choice to "Start Journey 2" which bring your character, armaments, level, and all, to do the story again, but the enemies hurt more and have more HP, but also drop more runes for leveling. Each cycle that you do amplifies these things up until Journey 8, which is as hard as it gets, but you can still restart the game with the same character endlessly if you wish. Benefits of starting a new journey with the same character also include trying new endings, and doing/getting things in case you missed them last time. But if you want the game to be easier for you, you have multiple options. You can summon up to 2 players at a time to aid you or use spirit summons in areas they're allowed. You can also go somewhere else to grind for levels so that you stand a better chance in an area. You can even look up enemy weaknesses if you'd like, as there is a massive community for this game that has knowledge about it all.  - Friends and Foes - There are multiple ways to interact with other players within the game. The first thing to note is that there aren't other players simply walking around in this open world, but instead, you see messages and bloodstains. The messages are written by other players using a small list of words. These messages can be helpful, funny, pointless, or deceitful, but generally it's a good idea to read them on your journey. Bloodstains can be interacted with to show a red phantom of another player's last moments before death, which can show you how dangerous an area is. White phantoms can sometimes be seen phasing in and out of your world. These phantoms are other players as they simply play the game, and they're a nice reminder that others are doing just as you're doing. Summon signs can be placed down so that you can be summoned into another world to help another player. Up to 2 players can be summoned by the host at once, and once at least one has been summoned, your world can be open for invasion. An invasion is when a player uses an item to search for worlds to invade so they can kill the host. Red summon signs can be placed to to bring another player into your world so you can fight them. If you want a fair pvp experience, there are 3 colosseums throughout the land that have their own sets of rules to play by or choose from. Lastly, if you are invaded, you can use an item to call for help so you have an ally summoned to rid the invader.  No matter how you want to play this game, the right way is the way YOU choose.   [Design]  - How the design affects the gameplay - Elden Ring has a massive amount design elements that merge amazingly with the gameplay. The developers of this game are known for environmental storytelling. By surveying your environment, you can get insight into the story of the game, or know if an area is dangerous. But many of the design elements of the game can influence a player's decisions. I suggest that you pay attention to your environment as you travel. :)  - Music and Ambiance - If the visual elements don't make a good enough of an environment for you, I found the ambiance to be perfect for every area I visited. The songs are elaborate and beautiful, and fit each situation very well. I haven't had a single issue with audio choice.  - Story - If you're a fan of lore, I have fantastic news for you. There are pieces of lore in just about every corner of the game. Weapon descriptions that give crucial detail on a specific character or location, the architecture implying the origins of a place, enemies being in specific places.   [My Thoughts] - My Experience - I have always been a fan of titles like The Elder Scrolls, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Pokémon, Dark Souls and such; games that give you an abundance of choice so you can play however you wish. Elden Ring to me is the best game I have ever played. The care put into it is immense, and I consider it a masterpiece. I can see myself playing it for years to come, trying new things or reliving the experience. Subjectively, it's a 10 out of 10 for me, because the shortcomings pale in comparison to the strengths, and that's how I think. Objectively, there is no such thing as a perfect game. There will always be imperfections and issues a game will have, but I can see Elden Ring as being one of the top games of this decade.  - Is this game for you? - Regardless of what games mean to you, I suggest that you try it out for yourself to see if it's for you or not. Generally, if you like open world, challenge, choice, multiplayer, and stunning graphics, I would say it's likely you'll enjoy Elden Ring. Issues that I saw from myself or other friends that played the game, it's a pretty demanding game when it comes to your PC specs. Often times a friend of mine would have FPS issues and needed to turn the graphics down a bunch, and it ended up looking pretty rough. Although lag is an issue in every pvp experience, it was especially frustrating to me in Elden Ring because much of the core gameplay revolves around timing your inputs, and any delay is a big difference.
Great gameplay, stunning visuals, amazing characters. If you are looking anything in a game, this one has it.
Seek Grass...
Fantastic game.
final boss is poor game design and un intuitive to fight, this is a poor rendition of a typically fantastic final boss arcoss every other game by Miyazaki
Elden Ring is a rare beacon of light in the midst of low effort product and cheap cashgrab, truly a worthy spiritual successor of its predecessors Dark souls 1 and Bloodborne
Splendid game. There is so much to do its been a month since i got the game and im on my 4 character beacause i want to try everything. Almost each weapon is different and you want to try it all (even tho you can't :( ). Clearly worthy of the GOTY award
This game is good.
Great open world
I always found the Souls games to be a bit inaccessible, but Elden Ring was the first time I really "got" what is special about the genre and about From Software.   The unique world, with lore as deep as you care to delve, full of brilliant design and art direction, makes Elden Ring stand out as uniquely enticing among a sea of same-y open world games. There are no quest arrows or compasses, and minimal hand-holding in general; a refreshing harkening back to a time when RPGs didn't focus on being streamlined as much as they did on being immersive. Everything has an exciting air of mystery. You have to explore in Elden Ring, and it doesn't feel like a chore or a distraction or a time sink standing in the way of getting to the good stuff. None of the content here feels like filler. (The vast majority of it is optional, in fact. Side quests are not afterthoughts, they're the core of the experience.) Exploration is rewarding here. It's what you'll want to do as you play, and the game's design philosophy is all about encouraging it, letting the player mostly direct their own journey.  Combat can be difficult, yes, but also rewarding and deep, offering tons of build options where most things feel viable and nothing feels particularly obligatory. Most of what turned me off about the souls-like genre before, was not wanting to reach a sticking point and becoming frustrated with my inability to advance. Elden Ring is full of challenging bosses that you may bang your head against, but the open and non-linear nature of the game means you always have some other content you can go do instead if you get stuck on a particular encounter. Leveling up and finding better gear is basically always an option. Elden Ring challenges, and can sometimes frustrate, but never quite enough to keep you away. And the feeling of accomplishment when you are successful is all the sweeter.  It's clear when you play that for the game's creators, this was a labor of love. It's not perfect, but what flaws it has are easy to overlook in face of it's many virtues. If you're like me and you're apprehensive about it because of the Souls genre's reputation for difficulty and high skill floor, do yourself a favor and take the chance on this one. You may surprise yourself, and this game will probably surprise you.   
Is lit.
fun
First FromSoft game I've played so it took a second to get into, but once it clicked it quickly became one of my favorite games of all time.
good
lost my sanity wouldrecommend
elden ring, O, elden ring
I read a lot of reviews about this game being the best game ever made, I didnt believe them at first but then I tried the game for the first time and it was the best gaming experience iv ever had, the game is perfect from the audio to the story to the combat system its all super well made and thought of, truly the best game ever made
No maidens
buy it its worth it
My favourite part of elden ring is when the tarnished one said "it's elden ringin time" then proceeded to elden ring all over the place.
Amazing game
pretty fun
edgvfvdfbdfgbfgbxfgb
This one hurts. I want to like this game. I really REALLY want to like this game.  But I don't.  Why? Becuase the first 1/2-2/3 of this game is good! Very fun, lots of enemy variety and exploring every nook and cranny is a fun and rewarding experience! The bosses for the most part were a great time to smash my head against. And then i got to the Atlus plains and the game became a boring irritating slog. Almost instantly too. The bosses become repeats of bosses you've already seen, the basic enemies are the exact same as the enemies that you've seen for the last 4 areas, just tankier and hit harder. The game feels like they front loaded it with all of the exciting content then desperately had to fill in the rest of the game with copy and pasted content.  It managed to retroactively dislike previous boss fights by having the exact same boss show up again, and im not talking about some random enemy demon or tree, im talking about storied named bosses that you beat and then they just randomly show up again. There are roughly 10 bosses that you have to fight only once. Out of 170. It is honestly one of the most frustrating games i've played in where the first 2/3 are really really fun and then you run into a steel wall of disappointment and frustration. Honestly is worse than Dark souls 1 and 3.
BEST GAME OF THE YEAR   
All of the things of this game is amazing. But the true reason i bought this is because of the wide amount of player information and jokes held inside. (even if it does get old sometimes). Unlike some of the other games i have or want. this game is leagues above in both stunning video quality and audio. the audio in this game is unlike any other with each boss seemingly having their own "theme" and even some regions having their own genre. such as the stormveil castle sounding completely different than Raya Lucaria showing the inventors brilliance and self inflicting torture of attempting to make a good game greater Reliant on nothing except the backgrounds. Honestly, if you do get this game for a few minutes just listen to the ambient sound, the birds chirping the horses clopping, the strange dog man hiding as a tree, and the random sound of a huge ass arrow being shot at you from 50 miles away. For me at least simply the visual(until you see some of the bosses!) and auditory features of this game make it worth the 60 dollars completely worth it.
A souls-like rpg that over-delivers what it promised.  - The character creation screen is fine with several customization options and a template.  - The gearing system is great, seeing the way your character changes during the journey, and wielding stronger armaments. Even though there are many tier lists, you are fine with any weapons as long as you enjoy them. - Boss fights are different from one another making them feel unique when you roll spamming for your life. - The huge map makes it easy to miss out on some of the optional bosses, so make sure you explore every corner. - The lore is great, but you have to watch some videos to better understand it. This is the first time I'm playing a souls-like game and after my first playthrough, I can easily say that this is one of the best games I have ever played if it's not the best.
After sekiro this was my next from soft souls-like game. Sekiro as a first time experience in this genre was tough. took me years of on and off playing to beat it. But this... I dont know if I would call it a game even. Its more than that. I think I can say that what FromSoft does is well passed extraordinary. Its changed my view on how I like, view and experience video games. And i've been playing games since i was 5 (am now 1 month away from being 24).  You know how people say "oh it grew on me" this does that but it doesn't stop growing on you. We're all curious naturally being human beings its in our DNA, our blood to explore and try. There's endless amounts of that in this game. The only thing that has more to offer, in that area of exploration and curiosity, is life itself. And as odd as that may sound for me to say talking about a video game. its true.  I might be a little off the wire becuase its 12:45am and I've just come off of a grueling 14 hour shift. nonetheless, if you thought about playing this game and can afford it then you should buy it and play it. But in your own way and in your own time.  All love. Ty for reading  
Just Beat Margit
Behold, hours or entertainment!
I NEED IT :(
w game fr
Elden Ring is a game that isn't even too ridiculously difficult, it's just kinda... boring. You don't get any progression until like... thirty hours into the game, and if you want to put that time into it, great, but it's just too hard to get into for me. I wouldn't recommend unless you are prepared to G R I N D. not worth the money imo.
Feels more like Assassin's Creed than Dark Souls.  Side-questing is a must or you'll be under-leveled, which is incredibly tedious in such a MASSIVE game. Most bosses and areas are just copy pasted versions of early game content which gives the game a samey feel. Really easy to make busted and cheesy builds, more fun to blast past the game the cheap way which, is overall a letdown for me despite how entertaining and rich the experience can be.
really good game. deserved goty
Heal *hit* heal *hit* heal, go on horse *hit* fall, heal, run *hit* lost 43076 runes
Its just insanely good
This game made me love souls like games now I want to play all souls like games.

i love every part of this game
this game gave me aids, schizophrenia and stick drift
Absolutely Amazing
dumped 40+ hours in 3 days, loved almost every bit of it
worth every penny
Masterpiece.   My major cons are: - Story/lore delivery is vague and forces one to use a guide to understand it, which isn't conducive to immersion - Some bosses rely on RNG to determine whether you're going to get hit or not - The combat item progression starts out very slow, I was tens of hours in before, as a spellsword build, I began to have multiple viable build options available.  Otherwise, the world, music, and art direction are generationally spectacular feats of creation. The mid to late game combat, boss battles, and weapon economy is enormously rich. The game is nearly technically flawless.
I cannot recommend this game more! Great game play, difficult bosses, a big map full of things to find. What more can you want. Put these foolish ambitions to rest.
Amazing game
"you have played this game 75 hours in the past 2 weeks"
Fun and easy game. Great for people not looking for much of a challenge, like minecraft.
probably the worst experience possible
Its Elden ring stop wasting your time looking at reviews and just play the game already

No better feeling than touching grace
easy
game make my brain go brrrrrrrrr
Game looks good, but there is no quest makers, no way to know what to do next without using a guide. Not a great game just a good one.
Very beautiful and rewarding game. Only peeve is that some of the bosses wind up their attack animation for unnatural spans of time.
Best game EVER hard but AMAZING POINT chop chop chop DEAD 
all my boys like elden ring
It's good
Did the B team make this game?
amq oyunu turkce olsa daha guzel olur
Yeah its okay. Where the DLC though?
Locked to 60hz, still shader compilation stuttering, no ultra wide...

very very good game

fun
First souls game for me.  I hated it.  Put it down for several months.  Decided to try it again because a buddy of mine kept playing it.  But during those several months, I was grinding the crap out of monster hunter world which I believe helped me understand the mechanics of Elden Ring.  You're grinding a lot, you want to build your character as much as you can in order to die less and in order to defeat the boss.  A game that i once hated but now I love because you realize how flexible this game is.  You play the game how you want to play it; you set the difficulty how you want to set it.  There are so many ways to play the game and i believe that is how a game should be.  On top of that, a very beautiful game.  Give this game a shot, be patient with it and it will give you the tools you need (literally like spirits to help you tank for example) if you choose to use it to enjoy the game throughout.  It's no wonder it won game of the year.  I've yet to beat the game and I've put in 180 hours already.  it's that big to get yourself lost in and have fun with it.
big sword 
very good magic is epic
its ok i guess
Best souls game to date, there is nothing I don't like about the game. When playing previous souls games I would usually think oh I wish I could do this, or I wish the game had that. Elden Ring has all of the things I had previously thought about wanting. It's amazing!
Excellent game, but hard for casual players
A game be so awesome like this should be considerate crime.
Did I platinum this game on PS5? YUP. Did I pay $60 so I could play this game on Steam Deck while I poop? YUP.
👍
woa.. fun to play
everybody makes me want to kill myself      Pope dog is alright though
badddddd
I was very on the fence about giving this a thumbs up. I am a  fond owner of most of FromSoftwares work even own an old copy of King's Field running around here somewhere. I feel like this is an awesome game in the skin of a Souls project. The open world is refreshing, the story is better told in a way to understand whats going on and you have some idea of where to go but often find yourself wondering whats around the bend. The combat for me is a slippery slope. The combat while fun and engaging fall short of feeling fair due to the balance of enemies HP pools you often feel like even basic enemies can be spongy and bosses are giant sponges and this really threw me off from enjoying the game thoroughly. Unless you lookup a build that breaking the game in some way, there isn't a great way to nab a regular weapon and feel okay going about your play without wanting to pull out your hair. Even though I don't care for the tanky HP I still feel like this game is the proper evolution of the souls franchise and can't wait to see what else comes out FromSoftware.
Play it. Don't try to kill Margit without proper gear and preparation - don't give up at the first required boss.
Could this be dog?
one of the games ever 
Playing this will get you all the maidens
Dog
It's fun and engaging
this gaem bad
I'm newbie to this whole "Souls"-thing, but I got hooked on by it. Started with the easiest classes and finally I am enjoying the Wretch-thing.
The best game ill ever play
y
its going to be another 10 years before a game like this comes out.
good
10/10
I like just about everything about this game originally I was playing on PS4 but recently got a PC
Gosh the amount of times, having to bite on a pillow and beg the gods to grant me strength, I have reached New game+7 and my gosh, i can see all knowledge in life. May The Golden Order Guide You Tarnished Victims. MAY CHAOS RULE THE WORLD >;) MAY THE GOLDEN ORDER GUIDE US
Try finger, but hole. (this is funny)
goodyyy
yeah i'd say it's pretty good
If you like fantasy games or challenging games this is worth the purchase.
:)
The best souls game imo, I bought it on PS5 when it came out but got it again on PC for its 1 year anniversary because I couldn't resist the urge to get all the achievements again. I don't PVP but this game was well worth the cost of buying it twice, I cant get enough of this game. Hype for DLC!
hard to start but hooked after
good .
A game that is actually worth the full price.
Playing on a laptop and on lowest settings. Holds pretty well. A shame I can't screenshot. I have to use snapcrab to use the screenshot feature.   Dark souls 1 and 2 allowed me to screenshot, so I hope fromsoft will allow steam to screenshot in the future.
I'd refund this game if I could but I can't so I'm going to do this instead. Thank you Miyazaki for your genuine worst game to-date, please do better with Armored Core.
;
This game has ton of replay ability. I have gotten 3 different endings so far and I just want to keep playing. The difference in the arsenal and the abilities keeps bringing me back. PvP can be annoying at times, but I find it grants an extra challenge. If i ever get invaded i get angry and hunt them to the ends of the earth.
Never have I played a game such as this. After beating this masterpiece I was filled with joy that I just defeated one of the hardest games you can plan, but then I started to tear up realizing I will never experience this game for the first time again. 11/10 best game I have ever played. (Note after kill the boss get the grace point before you end the game (I forgot to and softlocked myself out of the ending area)).
level vigor
good ass game
idk its just really good
Malenia is hard but you, my brave tarnished, are harder.
Don't play if you have heart diseases.
I didn't go to work for 2 weeks
literally one of the best games ive ever played worth every CENT.
gud shit
pretty epic
good game
Yeah it's pretty good.
this game is awsome 
A definitive milestone in gaming. This is to gaming what the godfather is to films, it will be remembered and replayed for many many years to come!
great game
One of the best games ever made
the dragon no woman.   f tier game
top dawg
Paid 0 attention to the story. Had a blast. Amazing fights. True blood-boiler. Would recommend + would play again 10/10
I got gud
it's good
nice game
After 136 hours with every second containing so much amazement, I have finally accidentally beaten the game.  More specifically, gotten a different ending than I'd liked. [spoiler](Don't tell the wife!)[/spoiler]  Elden Ring is the grandest souls game to date, with so much content that had me in complete awe from the second I started playing to the second I ended my playthrough.  The devs truely outshone the competition with this one, and it's going to be hard to compete in the future!  The only disappointment is that it had ended, but as the saying goes, "It is better to be happy that it happened rather than sad that it is over".  At least until the dlc comes out (hopefully) soon!
Great game with many options for character development.  If you like souls games, this one's a must!

Elden Ring, ok is imperfect but is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played.is my first souls game , is great and unique experience at all.
Me when alive: :D Me when dead: >:(
vewry godo 
"After about 50 hours in; I'm extremely disappointed. The obvious flaws of previous DS games is present once again (jank movement, enemies swinging through the same walls you bounce off of... the list goes on) but NOW there's even more jank! You have tedious ass platforming on a swivel stick goat, you have scaling bosses negating any sort of leaving, getting stronger, and coming back... you have no inspiration to explore because the boss you're stuck on will be just as (if not more) difficult when you return.  There are BROKEN npcs in this game. Example: There's a singing harpie in the lake that does piss all damage to you. You can sit still and solo him and the entirety of his guards. Unless. Unless he uses one move that AUTOMATICALLY HITS (it actually puts your character into an animation at it's start that becomes uncontrollable) and one shots you.  A random, singing, low level harpie. Has piss all stats but contains a ONE HIT KILL.  And there are a LOT of these scenarios. Balancing doesn't exist in this game.  The movement issues and fighting problems could be EASILY identified by even 10 hours of play test from one human, so I'm beyond sure they're aware and just throw it into the "Difficulty is fun regardless of design" basket they love to bank on.  The game is a slap in the face. It takes away the core concepts of an ARPG, but keeps the difficulty of pretentious level movement. And the pausing. Holy ever loving fuck, the ability for enemies to slow down one of their attacks at random in a string of nromally quick attacks. What the fuck? It's not something WE can do so why would you have to contest with it?  This game amounts to 100+ hours of jank deaths then RnG'ing through moves used into a victory that honestly... feels hollow as fuck by the end. I don't feel as if I mastered their moveset and could destroy them at any time now that I have; I just feel that one of their moves didn't AUTO KO me and I happened to pull a win. I don't feel like I put the work in to get stronger to surpass it, I feel as if it's the same fight as before I went and leveled. Once again negating my effort.  I'm sorry but. Not sorry. This game needs a massive overhaul to become enjoyable. Right now the only people sucking this game off are diehard souls fans who believe that FromSoftware can do no fucking wrong.  But. It can. And does. 1995 PS1 titles had better programmed clipping ffs." - DragonfruitCapable  The real reviews are on reddit. And theyre accurate save your money.  
GOTY. Need i say more?
This game cause only frustrations. However graphic is nice.
Dogshit game
great game, a bit too easy but i look forward to the DLC Coming in the future!
Works pretty well on steam deck surprisingly!
Fun game to get clapped too from time to time.
Never been so sad to finish a game in all of my life. Best game I have ever played, hands down.
Coming from someone who's played through every Souls game multiple time, plus Bloodborne/Sekiro, with Bloodborne being my favourite, this game is such a let down! They've essentially taken Dark Souls 3 and slapped it into an open-world.   My biggest gripe with the game is they've seemingly made the game hard just for the sake of being hard. It seems like most enemies, especially bosses, are all running at Bloodborne speed (with 360 gymnastics, jumping all over the place, infinite stamina, spamming combos, crazy damage) while the player character is running at Dark Souls 1 speed. Gone is the challenging yet fair game-play of their previous games.  My second gripe is the open-world aspect. It's so boring! There's not enough in it to actually explore, so you're essentially just running from one major area to another, with a few bits and pieces in between. The atmosphere and the look of the world is great though.  Elden Ring would've benefited so much more from proper interconnected world design.  Nearly everything else is also just copy pasted from previous games, the combat, the animations etc.   I'd say if this is your first From Software game, you may enjoy it, but, I would suggest you play Dark Souls 1 and/or Bloodborne instead.
I gave up early. Came back to it with friends and a respec. ITS BEEN SO FUN! Such Challenge! Amazing Hidden Lore! I went from 30 hours and quitting to 214 hours and my thirds playthrough New game ++. So much fun trying different builds and dlc is coming out! At first you will die alot and explore. Once you have some levels, a set build, and weapon upgrades it comes down to learning the fights and how to outplay bosses. Super fun and amazing time! Looking forwards to more and more Elden Ring! <3
already beat on PS4, playing again on here. peak.
I never wanted to play a Souls game until I found out that this game was fun, now its captured me into a new genre and I can't escape, I find it to be incredibly fun and somewhat challenging and I love the art style and depth of the game, I love how they allow you to go around the world at your own pace and explore and fight whatever you wish, the random encounters, the ones set to location or time of day are actually frightening when they pop up and you are not expecting them, clenching your butt cheeks as you try to deliver the final blow to a boss as they in turn try to deliver the final blow to you as you are 10% HP and out of potions.....good times!!!
Pretty good tbh
Is good Gemeh
EAT YOUR HART OUT CALL OF DUTY VANGUARD
Elden ring is the Dark souls of video games
BEST GAME EVER!  No really. You can't go wrong with this game. DLC is on it's way too.
I LOVE THIS GAME
one of best games ever!!!!!!
500 hours in and all achievements, still re-playable, fun and entertaining. Definitely one the top games I've ever played.
Pogchamp
It is the culmination of the game mechanics from From's Souls games, Bloodborne, and Sekiro into an open world, high fantasy game. Yeah, it's good.
Elden Ring is a game
Behold, dog!

10/10 best gaem
based
The game is fun for the first 20 hours, afterwards its just an average open world game. The bosses are difficult, but to me its the poor default keyboard controls that add difficulty to the bosses. For instance I can't summon without lifting my hand from the mouse to press the arrow keys. Not to mention that my computer died after 20 hours of my first play through and all of my save data was lost. I had to completely start over and at this point the gameplay was more of a chore than anything else. I don't know if I will end up finishing the game because every enemy I fight drains more and more joy out of this game. I have no clue what is happening story wise by the way. Like yeah I'm just another knight trying to become the elden lord, but some of the only exposition comes from dialogue dumps from the Marika character or whatever her name is. I would have played Bloodborne instead however it is not on PC.
It's Elden Ring. One of the greatest games of all time, made by an absolute gaming visionary. What are you waiting for? Go play it.
finger but whole
As expected, great game all around, not short of a masterpiece. However, it is not without its issues. The combat is great, but could be better designed borrowing some elements from its predecessors (as sekiro, for exemple) there is such a thing as greatly designed difficulty and poorly designed difficulty. This game stands in the middle. In conclusion; the combat is good and memorable but with some issues that start to become too clear in NG+. The PvP is suffering from same balence issues in the current moment (patch 1.08 -one of the clear issues is the new patched light roll, its is such a safe mechanic that a stalemate can be forcefully dragged the end of the match by just dodging as stated by some experienced streamers)). But I hope the devs will tackle those problems in balence patches later on. As I said before, all those issues aren't enough for me to not say that in my opinion, this is going down as one of the best videogames of the decade.
my 1st soulsborne game, easily in my top 3 all time
yes
     This is a diffrent game than im used to plying.  More skill based, no boss farming, losing ALL my runes if I die before I can get back to where they dropped, runes are what is used to level up, pay for upgrades, EVERYTHING !!!  And you will die ALOT !!!   The game does NOT hold your hand and keep track of quests, you explore and pay for your mistakes and learn on the way to greatness. In other words, im having a BLAST !!    Also, WIKI is essential and helps whene you get stuck.
I arrived.

Elden Ring. It's Good.
piece of shit

good game good 
its lal about geting gut
This game is so good that it is bad! If they were to chop it and release it as four separate game no one would bat eye on it. Its that good and rich.
Great game, challenging, stunning, fun weapons, creative lore.
Good game good. Play this.
A game that brings a completely different perspective to the open world, I have never experienced another game where every corner is so beautifully designed and filled.
Yes.
Good game. Maybe even Best game. I have spoken.
I've logged at least 500 hours into this game on console alone, and can easily say this is my favorite game of all time.
Insane.
This is a very good game.
Despite the open-world singleplayer RPG genre continually devolving into pointless fetch quests, poorly written dialogue, and excessive hand-holding, Elden Ring stands out by doing everything exactly how other games don't - and it works beautifully.  This is essentially my first Souls game. I very briefly played DS3, and barely played Sekiro, so I began Elden Ring with an open mind and virtually no expectations. I assumed I'd be in for an interesting, combat centric pseudo-RPG that would be confusing and frustrating.  That's what I got, however for some reason, despite initial frustrations with difficulty, the overload of information that is the stats screen, and the complete lack of guidance in what to do, Elden Ring is absurdly captivating. The environments are varied and gorgeous, dungeons are clearly crafted with care and attention to detail, and characters are interesting (lovable sort ahead).  This is the first game that has had me absolutely and entirely immersed since some of my all-time favourite single-player experiences such as Fallout: New Vegas or Skyrim. The Lands Between is an expanse packed to the brim with fun content, interesting loot, and once you start exploring you never want to stop. The questlines are interesting (though you'll definitely need some help from Fextralife), and the boss fights are straight up epic. The music is downright beautiful and the visuals are so unique, so stylized, and so gorgeous in so many different ways.  I have tried to write and rewrite this review for months, and every time, I feel dissatisfied with my own ability to convey exactly how much this game has blown me away. But now, I think I've found the perfect way to put it:  I put down Elden Ring after playing non-stop, clocking almost 300 hours. Wanting to scratch my open world RPG itch, I revisited Witcher 3 and put in a cool 70 hours then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. So I put together a new Skyrim modlist, spent probably 30 hours modding and troubleshooting and then another 30 playing, then put it down for a reason I couldn't understand. Hogwarts Legacy came out, and despite my love for the Harry Potter universe, for some reason I couldn't even push myself to finish the main story. I finally relented, and came to terms with the fact that I'd just rather be playing this game.  Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It is an undeniable champion amongst a stale genre saturated with mediocrity and tired franchises. It is a tour de force, a chef d'ouvre, a pièce de résistance. Yes, I pulled up a thesaurus.  Could this be a dog?
Elden Ring hentai futanari .
finger, but hole
this game is damn near perfect. Had never played Dark souls. But I have played Sekiro...and loved it,. This game is amazing. Many weapons. magic. lots of gear. you have a few different paths/endings you can take. but for the most part its straight forward. you get good by dying. lots. this game is great IF....IF you like challening. probably the best ive playd in along time. buy it, play it, and dont give up till you slay the elden beast!
Its Elden Ring, You already know.
เกมผู้มัวหมองตัวเหม็นๆ
my name is jimmy beast and i like videogaming. my son is very sick. he has testikal canser, plz donate to my PO box thx. 10/10
good
yes
If only I had a giant but hole.
Comparing this to other FromSoft games, Elden Ring has the best sense of wonder and exploration, as well as the widest variety in builds. That biggest downsides to this game is the lack of replayability and some repeated content, especially towards the end of the game. Overall, this is probably your best bet for trying to break in to the FromSoftware catalog as it is friendly to newcomers when compared to some of their other games.
still maidenless
Good game but 60 fps cap should be highlighted on the store page.
If I have to choose between my wife and Elden Ring I'll choose Elden Ring because I dont have a wife.
GOAT 
elden ring more like good ring
one of the greatest game of all time
Very Good Gane But Still sad since my save got deleted some how :(

Amazing game. Probably should recommend to anyone that wants to go and feel the game. Not only read about it imagine the lore but feel it. With deaths.
better than god of war
10/10
Great game, even if most of the dungeons feel the same, and the weapons are boring compared to DS3.
Litteraly best gem ever
NOTE: I played this game at launch.  It's okay.  This review will compare Elden Ring to Dark Souls III a lot for obvious reasons.  The open world formula hurts this game a lot. A sense of bewilderment is common when you move around with barely any direction at all. You get indications to sites of grace, but that's it. When i tried going someplace interesting on my own i got stomped instantly. If i didn't explore the crevices of the vast empty land, i was under leveled. If i explored everything then i saw the same ruins asset and enemies scattered everywhere. It felt like a grind and exploration for the sake of exploration.  When i moved on to the "correct" path, and there certainly is one, although the game nor the players tell you that, it all felt very good. The pacing was amazing. This harkens back to my previous statement; when the developer guides you in and puts you through the curated experience (i.e you play it like Dark Souls 3), it's really, really good. When you actually do open world content, it actually kind of sucks.  A huge flaw in design for me is the way they introduce you this danger. Spoilers: There is a point in the game where you get transported from the starting zone, to a much higher level Zone, Caelid. It's very obvious you are supposed to, and should, run. So i did. I got to a site of grace and went back home. This is introduced if you enter an obscure cave with a chest at the end. The run where i didn't do this, and entered as i normally would with Torrent, i got stomped by the enemies and lost my runes.   Therefore, it's apparent to me that the game is made to be explored and scoured for treasure. However, this content is repetitive. The same reused caves and bosses are littered across the map and give you cool stuff. The enemies here are annoying and the same in all of them, with varying layouts. Completing these is mostly a chore you do to unlock things. Not once did i do a dungeon and find it a refreshing or interesting experience. Oh, and if you skip all these you will likely be under leveled and miss out on all the cool stuff.  Following the curated experience is good. I wish they had taken more steps to gently guide you in game instead so they could lean into what they do best, the "dancing" with the bosses. Dark Souls 3 had exquisite combat flow and each boss had a built-in rythm to learn, with few exceptions (looking at you, Oceiros). The satisfaction from completely dismantling a boss by learning their every move was amazing. It truly felt like you rose from the ashes and became stronger by learning every time. The bosses in Elden Ring attack you so mercilessly that you offload some hits to your summons instead or just abuse magic so you avoid the combat.  The openings you gain are therefore the boss attacking your meatshield instead of your own skill dodging their attacks and abusing these openings, especially if you use heavy weapons.  I repeat, the intended way to play the game is by not interacting with the boss.  To see the anthisesis of this, and my ideal version of the game, look at the Iudex Gundyr or Dragonslayer Armor fight from Dark Souls 3.  To summarize, I feel the design around summons and the bosses are poorly done. Removing summons in boss fights, if not altogether, would drastically improve the game. There is no option to not use summons unless you want to use exploits, metagame or otherwise play OP builds, and not what you find fun.  The weapons and ashes of war are good. The combat is better with more variation and more moves to learn. The progression is there.  TL;DR The game is okay, but ultimately dissapointing coming from Dark Souls 3. Two steps forward in some directions, two steps back in others.
"MALENIAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, Blade of Miquellaaaaaaaaaaaaa" TT
nice game
Good shit
at first i thought this game was bad because i sucked now i dont suck, and its goated
this game is like cock and ball torture, without the cock and balls
Great world nice atmosphere
Lovely game, git gud
GOAT
game of the year.
Hello, I'm a fellow Tarnished. I've become an Elden Lord by using STR build.  My journey is fun, killing Varre, helping Ranni become a God, slaying Malenia in 5th try.  I also dont broke any controller or rage quit. Elden Ring is fun. Recommended.
I'm actually too bad at this game to have gotten far enough to form an opinion. I'm not sure if it's good, but I've seen worse. Biggest negatives are the EAC causing insane microstutter, and the hard cap at 60fps. Easily fixable with mods, but it's a bummer not to be able to play online with chromatic aberration disabled and uncapped framerate.

Weak foe ahead. Enter boss room. I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella   10/10
If you are a fan of dark souls series this is the game for you as this is dark souls 4 with a new name. Otherwise it is an overwhelmingly difficult game, with a very cryptic story (to hide absence of good a plot?). Besides this looks and feels like a lazy port from consoles. The game doesn't even support ultrawide screens.
 :) 
miserable
This game's too big I'll never beat it all. I prefer the focused/quasi-linear soulsborne experience but of all the sprawling non linear open world games this is the best. Also do not level Vigor that's a scrub stat. Instead learn to dodge the comically long windups so you can level Str for the giant unga bunga swords, dex for edgy weeb katanas, and int for the 500 wildly different spells.

Just found out this game has a giant finger for a great hammer. 10/10 easily.
It's pretty fun I guess.. eden wing..
yup
good game.... (they forced me to give a description. send help)
bad game
This is easily one of the greatest games created in a long time, if not one of the best games ever made to date. highly recommended
Speaks for itself
you constantly get roasted for having no hoes from literally every person. 10/10  I recommend Seamless Co op Mod for people with maidens.
Played 300 hrs on my PS4 and bought it on winter sale. Still enjoyable to play. I wanna try more different builds after running another Greatsword build. !!! LETS GO DLC !
yes
Bought the game 4 months ago and didn't touch it, now it has a me bound to it.
I have to say, Elden Ring is easily one of the best games I've played in recent years. The world is absolutely stunning, and the level of detail that has gone into creating it is truly impressive. I found myself constantly getting lost in the game's vast open world, always discovering new areas and secrets.  The combat mechanics are also top-notch, as expected from a FromSoftware game. Every enemy encounter felt like a challenging and rewarding experience, and the boss battles were some of the most epic and intense I've ever played in a video game.  But what really sets Elden Ring apart is its storytelling. George R.R. Martin's involvement has clearly had a significant impact, as the game's world and lore are rich and deep, with plenty of twists and turns that kept me hooked throughout.  Overall, Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a game that truly deserves all the hype it has received. It's a must-play for any fan of action RPGs or FromSoftware's previous titles. I can't wait to dive back into the game and uncover even more of its secrets.
OHH ELDEN RING
no game has made me as delusional as this i really felt like an elden lord irl after beating it.... dlc coming soon chills.....
it's the most video game
If you like Darksouls, play this game. Its different in a good way keeps the play fresh.
A Complete Masterpiece.
Incredibly fun game play, but I wanted to play it with a friend and for some reason From Software can't figure out how to make a multiplayer system that is actually functional. If you want to play this game with friends I would look elsewhere.
Game is dope. Play it.
Always fun.
very good game, would recommend using controller though.
this game is garbage
Ring
VERY EPIC RING
Had to see what the hype was about. It was real.
Is quite Elden And Ring
Amazing game - It's like a third-person, dark Skyrim if I had to describe it. Like a dark Elder Scrolls Online. Be patient you need to play to understand the storyline.
this game stinks
try finger but hole
It's a friggin' souls game. If you're into them, you already know whats good. Strangely enough, I actually had a hard time getting into it. Since I've played the souls games since Demon's, I learned that the games have so much hidden.... EVERYTHING that it's easy to miss stuff. And since this is open world now, it's even EASIER to miss stuff. Because I'm one of those dummy's that needs to collect all the things, it made it really intimidating when I first started playing. Eventually I got over it and just enjoyed the game, because it's just excellent. Heck, even the story isn't as convoluted as the other souls games. Don't get it twisted though, you'll still be confused.
let me touch grass 10/10
play it.
such a great game 10/10 the game play is difficult but very rewarding

Defiantly my most recent favorite game of all time right next to Chess
not worth the money but gtare game
UMBASA.
It's been almost a year since this game's been released, and I've gotta say I still love it.  When it first released I got about 110 hours into my first character, now that I'm back to playing it again on a new one, another 50 has been put in. The game certainly has it's strong and weak points, but if there's one thing I like about this game is the different play styles you can utilize.  Full Fledged archer is next on my list..
Dog
Its good
This game has three very specific ways you have to play it, and I wouldn't necessarily call any of them fun or rewarding. While there might be some nuggets of enjoyment to be had scattered throughout the game, they're packed with a trove of bloated content and bosses that aren't difficult in a way that tests your skill, but more if you've grinded enough or are spamming the right tools/items. Stick to FromSoft's past games, even some of their oldest works shine brighter than this mess.
liked everything about this game and i hate these types of games
good game 
Love From soft Games. This is like dark souls 1 on crack and 1000 times better 
Help
This game is life changing.
I've waited 5 years for this game to come out and I cried playing it because of how amazing it was, I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a while.

Good game. It's dark souls open world. If you like dark souls/bloodborne, you'll like this.

Hardest game ever completely lost fml
It's even better than everyone says
Very addictive if you like action and adventure. Very tough and versatile builds. I recommend for anyone.
7/10
the adventurer begins its a really good game soul crushing but still fun to play
Abject garbage, absolutely terrible but in the best possible way.  This game shouldn't have won Game of the Year because it's not a game, it's so much more.  You'll one shot a major boss easily and then immediately die to giggling dwarves 5 minutes later.  You then see a message 10 minutes later that says "dung."  You like the message without knowing why.  3 hours later you come back and a boss that makes you scream in frustration is there.  This is a metaphor for dealing with life and the answer is always "idk man just do whatever works."  Brilliant.
Can you have sex with the maidens?
its alright
great game
[h1]Pretty damn good. - 9.25/10[/h1]  Alright, just to start off, I truly believe this game is fantastic. But to truly appreciate it, you have to go in with the right mindset. Oftentimes it seems like people hop into this game to prove something to themselves or others and then have their fragile egos shattered when the game proves to be a bit of a challenge. This was sort of how I went into the game. A buddy of mine who was a bit of a Souls veteran decided to brag a bit about beating the Tree Sentinel (first field boss you come across) at base level (they chose Vagabond, I think). So I thought to myself, "I'd like to do that too". And if you've never played a Souls game (me), it's a bit of a humbling experience. However, your persistence WILL pay off. My first time beating the Tree Sentinel took probably more than 40 tries. My successful run was about 20 minutes long and I felt great since I beat him with a Level 1 Wretch. Now, I've learned to beat him in under 3 minutes. That's the thing, you just get better. When you can keep your appreciation for the game above your ego, you can have hours upon hours of fun while watching yourself become better at the game. I'm currently about to reach 500 hours as I'm typing this. Still having a blast with the whole thing. That being said, there are some definite pros and cons to the game which I'll list:    [h1]Cons:[/h1] [hr][/hr] -[b]Mouse and Keyboard controls.[/b] Honestly, I played through the entire game with mouse and keyboard. It wasn't horrible, but it was quite frustrating. From what I've heard, it's a constant FromSoftware issue. The games are supposedly just meant to be played on controller. I had a constant issue trying to do charged heavy attacks. Any time I'd hold down the heavy attack button, I would be locked into a light attack immediately after. I eventually managed to fix this by uncapping my frames with a mod, but we shouldn't have to risk getting banned to enjoy the game properly.  -[b]60 FPS cap.[/b] Last I checked, the game is still locked in 60 FPS. It plays very smoothly, but if you have anything over an RTX 3060, you probably want to see what Elden Ring can do. So I ended up playing the rest of the game at 170 FPS and 140% FOV using a mod. Was silky smooth after that.  -[b]Multiplayer limitations.[/b] So, if you're expecting to just hop into the game and play the whole thing with your friends, guess again. FromSoftware decided that you need to craft an item every time you want to play with a friend. On top of that, you lose access to your horse, summons, ability to traverse freely, sitting at graces, and from what I've seen, the ability to parry. It's just not a fun experience at all. However, there is a Co-op mod which fixes all of those things and is quite fun to play with. Invaders absolutely hate it, but nobody cares what they think anyway so mod it up. Just remember to disable EAC. v:  -[b]Awkward quest management.[/b] So, unless you're following along to an online guide, there's a pretty high possibility that you're going to progress passed a quest and potentially lock yourself out of content because of it. This then forces you to either make a new character, reload your save (assuming you're aware of how to do that), or go into New Game+. It makes for a unique first playthrough, but it is a tad annoying when you realize all the cool stuff you missed the first time around.  -[b][i]Some[/i] limited fashion options.[/b] Not really an issue, but you might struggle to find some decent armor combinations. I know I personally did, but I'm pretty picky.    [h1]Pros:[/h1] [hr][/hr] -[b]It's a complete game.[/b] You're not going to find any areas where it seemed that the devs were cutting corners. You could maybe make a point about some repeat bosses, but all in all, nothing seems unfinished. Some people had some glitchiness when the game first came out, but I didn't have a single issue aside from anything I've said above. Honestly, these last few years, we've sort of grown accustomed to the consistent theme of game developers who just want to release a product and fix it over the game's life cycle. ([i]*cough* Call of Duty *cough*[/i]) That's just not a problem here. FromSoftware had an idea and they saw it through to the very end.  -[b]Amazing design.[/b] It's not hard to get caught in awe while looking around in this game. It's insane to think that a group of people got together and made this. From the boss design to the environments to the animations to the UI elements, it's just beautiful. There are some funky looking things here and there, but you can look up the lore behind them and your appreciation for them increases tenfold.  -[b]Replayability.[/b] There are so many different builds you can run in this game. You wanna run a Bleed build? Level your Arcane and get a quick weapon like a twinblade or dual katanas. Want to just go around slicing things with a big sword? Well, there are plenty of big swords in this game. Two-handing a weapon goes a long way, applying a 50% increase to your Strength stat. Like magic? You can choose between Sorcery or Incantations, both with their own respective stats and equipment scaling. Or, if you're really hardcore, go around with a naked Level 1 Wretch and bonk things with your club. That'll teach Malenia.  -[b]Good confidence builder.[/b] A lot of people insist that this is one of the easiest Souls games. Whether that is true or not, the fact of the matter is, the game is difficult. If you can beat Malenia, that's something to be proud of. Most people uninstall at Margit. So beating this game is something you can consider an actual achievement. Not to say it's a rare occurrence, but it's a long shot from the straight forward goals of many other games.    [h1]TL;DR[/h1]  The game is worth a try. Even if a challenge scares you, the scenery and design of the world are quite the spectacle for anyone with a taste for quality. But if you're here for a challenge, buckle up because some of these enemies aren't throwing punches.
Game sells 20 million copies, can't be bothered to add native ultrawide support for a whole year. What the fuck From?
One of the best games ive played
Love playing this game. I have never spent so much time on a game and even trying different classes, each class has given me a way to play the game differently. I can't wait for the DLC.

I've been an avid action rpg player since I was a kid, starting with Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast.  In 2022 and 2023 I played a lot of Splatoon 3, Monster Hunter Rise, and am more recently Playing Risk of Rain 2, Valheim, and Deep Rock Galactic.  All of these games I listed have superb combat and very fitting combat.  They feel good, they're fun, and I find all of these games to control in an enjoyable way.  By that, I mean that they have excellent gameplay.  Elden Ring's gameplay feel and loop are very poor.  The controls and gameplay itself have offered me the least fun that I have ever had in an action rpg game.    Now, before you begin harassing me in claims that I just don't like "difficult" games, I found that Elden Ring is one of the least punishing action rpgs I have ever played.  If you are spending your runes, as you should, then death in this game is literally not a problem at all and there is no reason to fear dying.  So punishing is definitely not a term I would use. "Difficult" is somewhat of a subjective term, but what I am assuming players mean by "difficult" in this context is not "difficult", but actually tedious.  You really only have about 3 things that you might do:  One is to dodge, dodge, dodge, and of course to dodge again and again.  The main gameplay loop is to continually dodge poor optimized, in terms of time, attacks.  The key to not getting hit is to time your dodge, but if you play this game or watch gameplay, there are so many times when you expect to get hit but don't or expect not to get hit but do.  Ultimately, this leads to nothing more than spamming the dodge button like a madman as a go around to this issue.  And that ultimately leads to boring gameplay.    The second thing you might do is attack.  Attacks are done on a controller using the R1 and R2 triggers.  The R2 trigger gives you a kind of charge attack or a slower but heavier hit.  However, as we talked about timing issues, R2 is just far too impractical to even bother using with a basic melee weapon.  It is better to get your poke in with an R1 then run, or rather, to continue your dodge-athon.  Which leads me into explaining why this is so terribly boring.  You are spending most time avoiding combat and being disengaged for one, but more importantly, there isn't a lot of action coming from the player, or combos, or effects that might compromise the opponent, or disable them, or lead to giving the player some kind of advantage due to their fight strategy and so forth.  The action part of the action combat is the player running and evading a barrage of attacks or projectiles from an enemy combatant.  Sure there are spells and you can summon pets or something to spice things up, but if you want to play, or rather, engage in combat, your access to participate in the process of action within this ACTION rpg are incredibly limited.  The third main thing that might comprise your gameplay is using items, which would be a bomb, or a heal potion, or mana potion, whatever you are carrying with you.  These potions are your main source of healing or mana rejuvenation and you will be using them a lot to continue your combat participation.  However, there is a very very big problem with this system.  You want to make sure that you have the item you may need to use on the fly as your selected item because you do not want to have to change active items during combat, as the joystick that controls your sprite is separate from the joystick to change items, which would be your d-pad.  Now, strategically this adds excitement into what would be otherwise very boring gameplay, due to the strategy of selecting items before engaging or running away so you can switch to your mana potion to continue casting spells, or whatever, but the real problem here is that you are literally taking control off of your character in order to access your items.  The switching of items requires a letting go of control of your character and creates a back and forth of engagement and disengagement.  Monster Hunter does this too with their item system, but in the case of Monster Hunter it has very little effect on your ability to continue engagement in the battle.  You can wire bug and dive back in.  In Elden Ring you dodge like a madman, get far far away, then switch items or heal or whatever, then dodge dodge your way back in.  It's simply tedious and boring and this is because your sprite completely lacks mobility.  And,  Monster Hunter does not make you feel like you are giving up control of your character to access items.   In sum, there are better games out there.  The popularity of this game just goes to show that it is not quality that people desire but to be a part of the popular.   The best I could give this game is a 7/10 and even that 7 seems overly generous.  The combat is boring, does not feel rewarding, makes you feel gimped and weak (not in a positive way), discourages engagement, and is severely lacking in complexity or technique.  Defeating an enemy gives you no satisfaction due to anything you have done and simply leaves you with an empty feeling of relief.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.

Ouch it hurts that I love this.
Video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWIkdB7Gn8E  ELDEN RING is what I always hoped and dreamed modern gaming would become. I am a huge DARK SOULS franchise fan and I would also declare this one easily the objective best one yet through the sheer hours of content at your fingertips.  You are tarnished. A forgotten and unimportant soul who is maidenless. Luckily you meet Melina who is willing to guide you through your journey as your personal maiden / waifu. She gives you the reins to a spiritual beast named Torrent and your objective it to defeat the Shardbearers and ultimately become Elden Lord through one of the various ways of doing so.  ELDEN RING is insane because it's a 2022 released game that is superior to all of it's predecessors and does not feature any kind of cheapness or monetization whatsoever. It's really a breath of fresh air and every waking moment spent playing this game is true peak escapism and entertainment factor. Featuring beautiful visuals and a way larger than necessary / expected world to explore. I've always liked the SOULS franchises' NPCs but this game takes it a step further in elaborating and explaining each and every character not to mention how cool they look and how they all stand out from each other.  The bosses are the reason to play these games and whether FromSoftware realised that or just decided to go with an open world filled with seemingly endless bosses isn't actually important. The fact the player has a map, a steed, and fast travel from the get go between Sites of Grace make the quality of life so good for veterans of the series who just want to ride past everything, enjoy the scenery, and defeat some legendarily high quality bosses. Many people claim this is the easiest SOULS game but they are definitely wrong since there are some bosses in this game that are far more difficult than anything we've ever previously encountered; the hardest bosses from past games were Orphan of Kos & Darkeater Midir, and those two do not even compare to the likes of someone like Malenia, Blade of Miquella in this game who is borderline impossible to do solo no matter how good you are. The world and it's levels are obviously easier then past games and I prefer it this way actually; because it rewards thorough exploration and gives the player the ability to choose how much of a challenge they actually want since they can seek out more powerful weapons and Ashes if they want, and get early upgrade materials that will out-scale the majority of the game, or you can simply follow the linear path and go from story required boss to story required boss in a straight line without enhancing your character too much which will prove much more challenging.  ELDEN RING is a one of a kind game and shows us how far FromSoftware has come from the cash grabby low effort days of something like DARK SOULS II. There will be nothing like this ever again I assume and if you only play one video game for the rest of your life, choose this one.  10/10.

Quite possibly the best game I have ever played.

Very good Game. But me being maidenless at the start of the game made me wanna hate miyakarri
Give it a shot, you'll die a little, you'll explore a little.
I love walkin around. Fighting things feels rewards.  and its super fun to play with friends. Being invaded is fun even if you lose

It's okay
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
i walked around for like 3 h and did nothing . the enemies i can kill are not worth it, and the other ones i can't kill. and its just soooooo boring . w t f? why the hype? finished dark souls 1,2,3  and both nioh . never felt like such a massive waste of my time . just walking around in this game makes me angry . do i need to play for 50 h to start enjoying the game ? edit : found a nice farming spot and eventually killed margot the fell . its still like a 6 out of 10 so far
yes
I love the thick girls that are in this game 10/10 would play again for the big booty.
As someone that always hated the Souls saga (Played Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3 on PS4 + Demon Souls Remake) I gotta admit that this one is fun to play, it throws you off that it has no difficulty selection but I guess that went into the class of character that you choose, I hear that the Astrologist is the easiest one. I went with Samurai. I am having so much fun with the game. It is a challenge. But killing your first boss after putting so much effort gives you so much satisfaction. I haven't played multiplayer yet but I bet is fun to play with others. I am going to keep playing this game through. Never give up and give it a chance.
bruh
Not your typical "walk-thru'' type of RPG.  Definitely takes some exploring (or googling) to find best practices within the game.  Very cool open world, although some enemies repeat, they are altered just enough to make them feel "new" to that part of the world.
touch, but hole
Everything
Best game of all time anyone who plays is a fucking W 
I'm over 1000 hours in and  still find new things when I play though the game.   Elden Ring is up there with the best games I have ever played and is easily the best open world game I have ever played.   If you want rewarding exploration, great combat, and challenging bosses this is an easy recommend.
This might be the best open world RPG out there, i am already on my second playthrough.  This is my first FromSoftware game that ive completed, ive dabbled in Sekiro but not anything more. It is very nice to new players but still gives the player a challenge. The amount of spells and weapons creates good grounds for many different builds.   The lore is great, but nothing less is to be expected from a FromSoftware game. The open vast world gives the players many different areas to explore with unique and fun level design.   The combat is excellent and rewarding yet punishing. Taking your time to learn the bosses movesets is fun and when you beat that boss with no heals left you feel the best sort of adrenaline rush.  This will absolutely push me into the FromSoftware games franchise.
Worth the hype, use a guide if you're stuck, fuck those guys
If you have never played any dark souls like me and start with this you are in for a great adventure. At first played the game on a bandit and quickly made a vagabond because I sucked at my first guy and then from there it was the most enjoyable game ever. Highly recommend the game to anyone.
10/10 just beat radahn 1 year later
yeah it's pretty good.
best game I ever played

Great game
This is the best video game to grace humanity since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
Boc the Seamster is the true Hero.
Blade of who?
Great game. Doesn't give you much in terms of knowing where and what to do, but it is very rewarding once you do

[H1]So what's it about?[/H1] You are are revived and you find yourself in the Lands Between. Embarking on an epic quest you will need to find and to do what it takes to become and Elden Lord.   [H1]The good[/H1] The visuals, sound and music are stunning. The world building is great: there are so many locations to explore, so many secrets to discover and the monster design never gets boring. And then when you have thought you saw everything you are thrown in another big adventure. There are optional areas in the game that you may just walk by because you don't realize they are there. There are bosses and mini-bosses that you will not see unless you look for them. It brings you back to how games used to be: explore and find new things without everything being served on a plate to you. Being able to complete the game and then realize the game wasn't serving you all the content but instead you need to discover it is great.   The multiplayer portion is similar to Death Stranding where other players can leave you messages and you can see little blood spots where other players died. It's also cool to see the ghosts of others moving through the world and of course you can PvP if you want if you have the correct items. It's a good thing to fully integrate this in the game as prevent you from feeling lonely. There is some PVE and PVP and with the right items equipped you can select what you would like to do.  The items and equipment that you can find is absolutely amazing: even more when you realize that there are no DLCs, microtransactions or other schemes. You pay what you get and it works. I wish other games were still like that.   [H1]The not so good[/H1] The difficulty can be punishing at times - it's part of the charm of the game / series but you might get frustrated because you feel it's unfair. You will need to build your character and get to understand the game mechanics or the bosses will make quick work of you. Without the right tactics you will die a lot regardless whether you are a high level or not. It can be frustrating but all it means you are not good enough - level up, practise, get better and rethink your tactics :-).  You will need to use a gamepad to play this game. I cannot see how you can play this with mouse and keyboard. I used a Switch Pro Controller and that worked great.   While not experiencing bugs or system issues I got several disconnects from the multiplayer part because of "Inappropriate Activity Detected, Unable to Start in Online Mode". I have no idea what happened here as I was just riding my horse at those times. Usually after 10 - 15 minutes I was able to logging back on.  There are many extended quests in the game. You will not realize this at first as there is no quest book, tracker or even on-screen notification. As you can kill NPCs you may lose their story lines without even realizing it.   You will have to make choices but there is not really a good or bad one so it's much how you want to role play. Because of this system as you may like to explore a lot you will find that quests have moved on: NPCs moved to a different location than you expected or you just don't realize there was a quest at all. This can be a bit annoying at times especially when you have play sessions every few days. It's hard to get back on track without making lots of notes.  The marker system on the map only allows 100 bookmarks but there are so many more areas to explore. I wish the limit was raised as in the end I had to keep track of my progress in a notepad. Very much how I used to play old style games.  Why can't we turn off chromatic aberration? I know there is a mod but I didn't want to play my first play through using a mod.  Your character cannot swim or climb I loved that in Zelda Breath of the Wild or Assassin's Creed and I wish we could do it here as well.  There are many, many systems in the game that you find or miss. Basically, you can upgrade just about everything but you need to find the right location, NPC and items. The game will do little to hold your hand it's up to you to discover.   [H1]Summary[/H1] I enjoyed my journey through the Lands Between so far and I will definitely return. It was tough at times but it felt like a breath of fresh air. The visuals and audio are some of the best, I have ever seen. The world building is amazing and I enjoyed all the secrets that I found but also that I learned there is even more to find. Hopefully other developers will study what Elden Ring does well and learn from it as it sets a new milestone for open world gaming.
Greatest game ever made. I've said all I wanted.
I want to love this game so bad. The exploration and world building is only next to a game like outer wilds. Just wandering around this world feels so great and fills me with so much wonder and it baffles me to think all this land with rich history was forged by a game studio. Coming over a hill to see more land after I though I'd reached the edge of the map and the excitement that I get filled with is literally incredible. But that excitement is immediately thwarted by a large sigh and disappointment when I see a boss that's going to be tedious and frustrating to fight.  This is why I know I can't love this game because the bosses in the game are just not fun to fight and there's over 100 of them spread over every inch of this beautiful map.   The bosses are just tedious and feel more like I'm supposed to put more hours into leveling up than practicing to beat them. A large majority of the bosses contain move-sets and combos that can last up to 20 seconds only leaving the player to get in a measly hit which does a sliver of damage. So the player has to hope that within this insane, unreadable dance of attacks they don't get hit lest they die and then barely make a dent in the boss's health...Then repeat over and over again and then you have a large majority of the boss fights in this game. This form of combat feels less like a duel between worthy adversaries and more a like a toddler against Mike Tyson. Its just so tedious and doesn't leave the player satisfied for beating a challenging foe but instead leaves them exhausted and glad they don't have to do that fight again.   I do recommend this game though. Its like actually insane how fantastic this open world experience is. I just think its unfortunate its bogged down by the horrendous and tedious boss combat. I don't think Elden Ring is a masterpiece by any means but its definitely the best concept game I've ever played. If FromSoftware can make another game of this same scope and open world combined with lets say the combat of Sekiro, my god would that be the game of my dreams. But unfortunately the combat drags down one of the best open worlds I've explored.
Good game becoming god has always been a dream of mine and i'm glad to be working to accomplish it
gud gaems, git gud
10/10 
Honestly, this game is boring. After 900 hours, I still haven't found a reason to keep playing it. Honestly the items are way too fun, the lore is cryptic and it feels like an accomplishment everytime I piece something together. Boc is in the game (That's the only good part) so you can get mushrooms and entertain a poor exile's body dysmorphia (Or be a human being and acknowledge his worth).   Everytime I play, I give a friend a good smack on the rear and it makes my day delightfuly triumphant. I get to destroy a Flacidusex (The pokemon? Right?) and the pedophile dies, clear as day, near the end. "bUt UHMMM ACKSHUALLY ThEY ArE JuST vERY OlD it'SS JuSt A chILd's Body"   So anyways, the dislike is for Godskin Duo and the YeeYeeAss Imps and Burial Watchdogs, you get the meme by now. It's a great game, and I hope you go into this without googling too much.   Shoutout to Miquella for dropping us the fattest DLC teaser from their cocoon. Shadow of Mordor looks sick!  A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you. A man cannot kill a god. BECOME AS GODS!!!!BECOME AS GODS!!!! BECOME AS GODS!!!! Join the Serpent King, as family, TO G GETHER WE WILL DEVOUR THE VERY GOSDS  Good luck, Maidenless Runt
Dark Souls II 2, featuring [i] less [/i] bullshit and more gameplay. Powerstancing is back... well, almost, but it's still an improvement over nothing (Read: Dark Souls 3). Unfortunately it did not bring back Dark Souls 2's incredible system of having armour pieces that can be worn separately and still look good, and the lack of armour upgrading means that looking cool requires you're able to play well. Still not Bloodborne 2, but it's progress, at least.  All this said if I see a fucking bonfire or Estus Flask in Armoured Core VI I [i] will [/i] shit bricks.
Even the tought of playing this game gives me an erection.
As my first FromSoft game Elden Ring is a very good game, the open world is massive and the combat is just very satisfying. I reccomend to anyone who loves open world game or soulsborne games.
Game good... play... happy
Fun
Please give me some points. I want to buy a background, but I have no money. Although it won't make your cow grow longer, there will be one more person in the world wishing you well.
You might spend a little time in this game.   Totally worth it
git gud
absolute masterpiece. FromSoft deserves all the praise! 11/10

Best game ever made by FromSoftware
One of the best games I've ever played. Almost everything about it is amazing. For people who fear the difficulty of the Dark and Demon Souls series. There are so many options to finish and experience the whole game even as a bad player (as I'm). Summon NPCs. Summon even more NPCs. Use broken and overpowered character builds. Summon other players for help or overlevel the content.
I thought "time for suffering" so I bought this, and then behold, strong foe! Then this really shady role-playing "maiden" comes along - conveniently right after this other fella called me maidenless - and she's like "Erdtree, and then seek Elden Ring". Okay, will do!  Next thing I know, I'm trying fingers and everything bloody else I can scavenge because imps keep stealing my runes. "Try parrying" you might be thinking, well I'm trying but the noob in me hasn't packed his things and moved out just yet. Nobody I'd met thus far felt it worthwhile to mention all the death ahead, and then death ahead, but death ahead it is. If death was a currency I'd be the Jeff Bezos of the Lands Between, I tell ya. "Stay calm, seek strength" I said to myself as I dragged my demolished ass through Brazil after some vapelord decided to play a hilarious prank gone wrong, and that was only the beginning!  Boy, is this an experience. Gorgeous view, dog, Bill Clinton, sweet man-made horrors beyond my comprehension... could this be the game of all time? Because it's time. It's Mohgwyn time. And I intend to mohg all over that Sekiro reject - I didn't catch her name - who likes to dance with waterfowl or whatever.
best game ever made .
World is very immersive.  I found the combat tricky but rewarding.  My only issue with the game is that the storyline is pretty bland and often requires you to have met random people at the right time.  Otherwise game totally lives up to the hype.
this game has more content than almost any game i have ever played. buy it.

This is totally the biggest disappointment of the year in a game industry, such a huge game, a such potential, the game of the year and.. no proper co-op or multiplayer, no vr headset support... what a shame... multiplayer is a disaster.. if u like a singleplayer the game is for u.
totally crap well over rated
if you're worried about difficulty, don't be.  Just start up and learn. You'll love it without too much time passing.
gg
very gud gam
The seamless co op mod is what this game should have had  inside the game the co op part of the game is hoirrible for such a great game i had to quit and go play seamless co op just to play normally with my brother if you are looking to play with a friend do it thru that because here i cant ride my horse with my friend cant even explore the world together properly  every time he dies i get kicked out i can be higher level they lower me to nothing i barely have potions i cant use a grace or nothing this is a bad version of a game
10/10
This really feels like The Game Of All Time sometimes for me. Check it out, genuinely. Is it too hard? That's okay, you'll get better at it.
very fun but very hard also if you like grindy and adventure games this is real good
greatest game ahead ⚔
Le vieux ring
hello
There's very little I can say about Elden Ring that hasn't been said before, so I'll keep it brief.  Try Finger.
it good
It is what it is.  And you probably know all about it already. Unique though,
Do your self a favor and buy this game.
It's a masterpiece in itself It's one of my absolute favorite soulsgames The world feels so alive, the combat is really smooth there's always gonna be stuff that can be made better, but to me the game is great  I feel like this is one of the easier games tho, but I'm not sure if it's because of me having much more experience with soulsgames, or if it's just easier, but I feel like it leans more towards me having played precies fromsoft titles  The only big con for me is that I have lag, even on lowest settings but I believe it's just my pc being crappy  i7-4790k Gtx 1070 16gb DDR3
Elden Ring is more than just a game. It is art.
Its challenging in all the right ways, and the style of combat can be done in so many different ways  if you cant clear a challenge, go somewhere else for a bit or try changing how you'r trying to tackle it
Her name is Malenia and she is the Blade of Miquella!
Sometimes, it make you wanna go fight a bear, while walking on legos, an glass in your eyes. 10 out of 10!!!
Fun, challenging, absolutely gorgeous.
Get this game if you already haven't. You won't regret it!  I hesitated bit to get Elden Ring because I'm too old for hard games, but this turned out to be something different. It's not hard in a bad way, it's hard in very unique and rewarding way. Basically while playing, the player himself improves.  The world is beautiful and fun to travel through, not knowing what's behind the corner. There's lot of overpowered weapons, spells and NPCs helping in combat (called Spirit Ashes) that make the experience almost as easy as you wish. In fact, after completing Elden Ring twice, I wish there was less "cheese", but one can have his own rules in NewGame+:s like just not to use spirit ashes or strong spells. That's what I mostly did on my second play through, expect for couple of bosses.
The first npc you meet reminds you that you don’t get hoes, love this game
A well deserved award for Bill Clinton
Honestly an incredible game, the combat is amazing, and it's really fun the whole way through. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game on pc, there are tons of stutters and freezes, the game is just really slow in some areas, and there is nothing you can do about it, the performance issues are there no matter how good your pc is. I still truly believe the game deserved game of the year, and it has to be one of the best games I have ever played, but I would recommend getting it on console instead.
Gud Game
This game feeds my inner masochist. The amount of pain I derived from this game was nothing compared to the satisfaction of clapping the cheeks of your former clapper.
I put the new Forgi's on the G I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
Hype or not. I think this is a good game. Can it be hard? yes. Can it be beaten? yes. I don't usually play a game more than one play through. But the amount I learn and find out different things, makes me want to play it again with a new style. I'm not good at souls games. But I find this one fun because of how you can come up to the overpowered bosses after you've leveled up your guy and find some new gear and beat them down!
big pain in the ass but i can hug women
ass game dont recommend
Great game. Worth every second that I played it
Good game.
One of the best games ever made
my first souls game and even tho I was sceptic at first, I had a great time. takes some getting used to and you will feel a bit overwhelmed if you're not familiar with FromSoftware games but it was GOTY 2022 for a reason.
Good
great game
maidenless
absolutely great game. single player done right. not shoe horned. difficult enough to be a challenge but not unfair.  working on my mac via bootcamp
.
10/10
Can someone help me beat margit the fell omen? ive been stuck on him for a bit
amazing game!
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella 😭
I had not played a "souls" game before, and elden ring has absolutely hooked me.
It took me 40 hours to enjoy this game.  Now I cannot stop playing it. It's a fucking drug. It has Ranni's feet, it's enough, buy it.
Another rare example of modern gaming era where a game is created by the company's principles, integrity and hard work of its people, and voila! No bullshit, no money-grab mechanics, pure immersive gaming experience in a world deeper than any other so called "open world" games combined in the current market Just buy it and if you are new to souls game, try to give yourself uninterrupted first 2 hours. No matte what happens keep playing, end it with sort of an achivement, small boss, item discovery, check point you wanted to reach. Then take a break and come back full on!
It's visual, gameplay, and story elements are all incredible
Game of the year is well deserved. Now waiting for bloodborne on pc.
ELDEN RING
well deserved replayable game even after 10 years
First time to get interested to finish a Fromesoftwear game , years ago i tried Sakiro and love the setting  but enjoy the steep learning curve , got this on day one on Console and returned it immediately after playing it for few hours , but since Jan 2023 i was looking for a challenge as most games started to look like a copy of each other and not as enjoyable , so i got it again but this time for PC ,,, and OH man have i been addicted to it since then , can't stop thinking about how beautiful and Genius it is , it's still very hard for my casual play-style , but the sense of achievement i get from this game when i beat a boss is unmatched , looks like a 200 hr game to me
This has been the hardest game for me to get off of..ever! Yes it’s annoying as heck at some times but if the game ain’t making you rage, is it really providing you with a good challenge? This game runs flawlessly on my gaming laptop, it is incredibly fun, combat is very engaging and amazing, the magical spells you can get are a bit overpowered but it makes you truly feel powerful in this game, the bosses are extremely difficult for me but I’ll never forget the time I took out godrick on my second try after I lost once and went to the open world to get stronger. This is my first souls game so I did have to look up how to do a lot of stuff, but I do LOVE that you have no specific objective that you have to do, meaning you can do and (almost go anywhere you want). I see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours tbh..it’s just THAT good, I already have 32 hours in this game and there’s still SO much for me to do!! Even in 2023 this is still the BEST game I’ve ever played in my life, it does everything perfectly, and is just the best open world game I’ve ever played…I would HIGHLY recommend to play this game because even though it’s 60 dollars I feel like you definitely get what you paid for, and more! There’s THAT much content in this game
Not an interactive movie but a game worthy of the name.  The game has made me a better gamer on many levels.  And I've been playing for about 35 years.  Best regards, N
Multiple times with this masterpiece. First time on steam. over 1000 of hours played previously
Best game ever made, too bad I'll never see it all because it's so damn difficult
with 192 hours, and each session being roughly a hour long. I have to say this is one of the best games i have played in invested time into.
yes. yes. yes. forgot to do a review and all I can say is hell yes.
Soul game that you can jump? Isn't this game good enough?
Behold, Dog!
a good game if you already have a maiden. if you don't you will be alone...
I've never liked the Dark Souls series since I'm no masochist nor do I hate myself. Although the combat is very much the same I find it less clunky and no stamina consumption outside of combat is cool.  This game really pulls weight for those who like to wander and not be tied down to linearity. For every discovery lies a challenge and something valuable or insightful behind it. The grand scale of the well designed world brings up a lot of questions and consequently drives one to find answers which gets you more drawn into the game. I find the community is also better than DS. This is a game meant to be played with a 2nd monitor to pull up guides and general info. Argue all you want, you won't fool me to thinking dork souls is better
Yes play it good
W game 
After finishing a slow playthrough, throughout last year I would return to elden ring when I just wanted to exist in the lands between. The combat feels the best of all the souls-like games, the world is gorgeous, and all the bosses are anime as fuck! If this is your first souls game, this is definitely the game to play, as they have really streamlined a "choose your own difficulty" mechanics. Spells are more varied and magic is less intimidating to play at the start, spirit summons can make a lot of bosses way easier, and it is easier than ever to get summoned help. Use your mount if you can! Torrent is amazing, I've never played a game before where I felt the power of calvary, horses op, but in a good way.  I think Elden Ring has taken Bloodborne's place as my favorite souls-borne game, and I can't wait for the DLC!
GOAT
You filthy Ranni simp.
AMAZING!
Look at how many hours I spent on the game.
Best game I've ever played
I was fighting a boss with the same build i did for the entire game for 3 weeks. I got annoyed and swapped to some random build. I beat the boss on my first try.  10/10 would waste another 3 weeks on a single boss.
Me gusta but nerf summons
don't play this game
11/10 has a lot of small problems but its so overwhelmingly good it every aspect it dosent matter that much 100% worth the buy
THE LOATHSOME DUNG EATER

The best game I've ever played, it's kinda hard but the game gives you various ways of beating it while still being complete dogshit at it, just don't use summons, they cringe.
gud game
Is good
Well i get kiled ewerywhere. Ewery road has dude on horse with half map agro and dragons pop from nowhere too. Penalty for death are too big - you lose all xp (rune). Hard to control character. I have non stop to pull mouse down to see floor and hand get hurt doing it. I tried  settings but it dont hellp at all. Seem that game was not intended for PC users. Key binding is bad or non existent. For example to call horse you need to use both hands ( press E and hold it then  press arrow ) I did 30 hours of gameplay and realised that i throw away 60 USD on this game.
The best open world Singleplayer RPG made to date, and DLC is on its way, Worth every dollar.  Main critiques I have with this game is, the odd difficulty spike towards the end of the game but even then the game is still beatable, and the amount of things that you can miss out on if you don't get it at certain stages of the game.  an example of this can be [spoiler]When the capital city of Leyndell is covered in ash all prior items inside are gone[/spoiler] so watch out for that  and the disappointing PVP in comparison to other games this company has made in the past, I miss covenants :'(  all in all this game definitely deserves its game of the year award and I strongly recommend you play it to completion  Good luck and have fun.
Game
DLC IS COMING!!!!
godskin duo is pain
praise the elden ring
Simply amazing
Couldn't have start with a better souls like game. Worth every hours played!
Madness good
=)
What an absolute masterpiece of a game. Definitely deserved GOTY.  I have never played souls-like game before and I was very skeptical. In the beginning you are thrown in a massive world with little to no guidance and everything is written inside description notes found deep in your inventory. I, ofcourse, didn't knew about it and was banging my head around to find any useful information if possible.  Getting killed many times by Agheel Lake Dragon and eventually entering the trap inside ruins behind it xDD (I am pretty sure everyone suffered from it). Game felt unforgiving right from the start.  But, this is where open-word and true freedom started showing it's charm. I could just smack some dude and see if I am remotely capable of defeating them or not. Roaming around and going to depths as well as far away corners started paying off little by little. Although I was very slow at levelling up in the beginning (level 44 after 45 hours) but atleast I could explore at my own pace.  Took little bit help from "Elden Ring Discord Server" (very nice people) and kept going ahead. Beautiful locations and nicely optimized game were added bonus.  After a while, story and progression started to make sense and I could piece together progress map to move ahead and this is where the game began to look much more enjoyable. It almost took me 55 hours to fall in love with Elden Ring and realise it's GOTY awards. Completed lots of side quests and defeated almost every boss except (2 evergoals and dragon placidusax). Some bosses felt punishing even after learning so much and they gave true satisfaction upon defeating them.  My Rating - 10/10 (even without sale) Gametime - 100 hours (if a noob like me took 130 hours, I am pretty sure average player will take a lot less) 100% completion time - 150 to 160 hours.
game good
Dog ahead
This is one of the greatest games ever made. Elden Ring needs no introduction, it's a masterpiece that will change the way you look not only at modern experiences but video games on the whole.
👍
- Epic - Grandiose - Enchanting - Legendary - Monumental - Spectacular - Mysterious - Enthralling - Immersive - Massive - Intense - Haunting - Otherworldly - Majestic - Fierce - Beautiful  Masterpiece.
It's just too good. most other games feel boring after it, like  it was the end point for games and I've stuck around past the credits.
Masterpiece
Praise the Elden Lord
Perfect game. Best game iv played in years
waurrr (beats you with golden cock stick)
It has been a year, I should probably actually play this game.
Embolden by the flame of Ambition, thy flame cannot cannot be extinguished!
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.
horrible port
Elden ring is not a masterpiece.  the reason why i don't call it that is because it ain't all that good as people claim it to be.  to many people have low standards it's overrated.  dark souls 3 was better :( 
the game is really fun and looks amazing just can be annoying
Gitgud
Amazing game. Definitely deserves all of the GOTY awards it's received. Only complaints I would have is the horse combat and movement could use some work as well as some of the bosses having spammy combos that are hard to dodge unless you get lucky or dodge at the exact right frame. Looking at you Malenia and your water fowl dance. Overall the game is great tho. Difficult but not impossible. Probably one of the easiest games From Software has made if you take advantage of stuff like spirit summons. Still doesn't stop the feeling of accomplishment once you get past that one boss you've spent an hour trying to beat tho.  Plus the game is gorgeous and some of the bosses are a spectacle to behold if you're into that sort of thing. Definitely a must buy for anybody that's a fan of souls-likes. If you've never played any games in the genre this is a good place to start too.
Game of year
this game is full of unexpected enemys and boss fights the game looks beautiful and it is one masterpiece you can do so much
Outside of one complaint i have: This game is not friendly to mouse and keyboard BUT this game is hands down the best open world game i have ever played in my life. Fell in love with it and have played it eight times over now.
This is one of the best games I have played. I keep coming back. It's Souls. It's Open World. It's huge and nice to just lose yourself in. It doesn't get old for me.
I ignored all trailer and hype for this game. Just years of let downs from other games  taught me that.  But this. This gem delivered. And boi was I lost for the months I played.  Amazing game.
One of the best open world games ever made
This is one of the few games I would pay 100 dollars for.
good game 
This might be literally the greatest Elden to ever ring of all time. It's just Dark Souls' perfect style placed into an open world with even more character customisation options, ludicrous bosses, amazing areas and stunning secrets to uncover. If you are a Fromsoft fan, this is a required game to have in your library.
Best Game Ever <3 Addicted
The game is challenging, fun and set in a immersive world. It stands out from the rest and for me was a great buy.
best game hands down if you like a games you need to be good to play XD Shots fired "pew pew" 
good
yes
Good game even includes Wario and Waluigi.
By far my most favorite game.
zaza
Visions of Dog therefore, try buying.
I have wanted to end my life repetitively, but i can't stop playing 👍
great 
Very Good
best ever 
Immersive Fromsoft game, 9/10 because sometimes it crash, and pvp is not that smooth I don't know why  Otherwise, it's so good, the exploration, the world, the boss and the others
ds3 was better
Definitely!!
I like this game.
I really enjoyed dying so many times. It really made me feel happy! I cant wait to play more and more of this game!
makes me wanna end my life sometines
THE SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE, THE SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE IS REAL!!!
Men, if someone gave some money i'll probably rebuy this game. Maybe the optimization is ass, but aside of that is great and best way to play a Dark Souls experiencie.
(Note that all of my play sessions were exclusively with the seamless co-op mod because yay co-op and screw invasions and EAC.)  It's the dream. An open world Dark Souls game. What's not to love? Shame it lost game of the year to Bill Clinton. So many ways to play and it's fairly noob friendly while still chewing you up and spitting you out like a Souls game should. I can't beat bosses naked with a ham sandwitch like some people, but once you find a build and figure things out, it's godly. Iv'e got a Sephiroth rivers of blood thing going on for my main character and it's great.  If you love co-op and hate PVP like me, grab the Seamless co-op mod from Nexus Mods. It uses Steam servers and a .ini password instead of Fromsoft's servers, a separate executable and bypasses the need for Epic's performance sapping spyware known as EAC. Make sure you get your steed and your summon bell before starting because you may miss them during co-op, but it's 100% full time co-op without the usual Souls summoning signs and boss restrictions. It's glorious fun. Watching your friend get yeeted off a cliff by a pumpkin head never stops being funny. 
BEST GAME SINCE Super Mario
meh, it's alright for a Dark Souls 2 sequel
try fingers but hole
I get no bitches
its a great game. just try not to break anything while your at it.

The Elden RIng
Still haven't beat the game yet but I very much enjoy it
The conclusion the maurdman saga and an amazing game in its own right, Elden Ring is definitely the game of all time. we all know our orthodox rabbi bill Clinton would approve of such. To finally see the journey that started all the way back in dark souls 3 to dark souls 1 (skipping dark souls 2 but we ofc still mention it), maurdman has come along way from being a lil maurdboy. All the characters have grown, with returning cast of sleepy Joe, orange trump and Obama (maurdmans dad). The ending of maurdman finally getting the love her deserved after all the times he sacrificed his life to save kingdoms that didn't care about him (doing what obama said to "save america") have finally paid off, now our hero can finally rest. "Maurdman, I love you and you deserve this, I hope one day you can forgive me, because you were my hero all along," Obama.
boring
On my 6th play through so yeah it's good.  :)
Planning to get at least level 731 in this game. Supper fun
Incredible master piece.
Elden Ring won Game of the Year, makes sense, its a great game.  Souls-Borne games usually aren't accessible to newer players, but this one certainly was. Over 120+ hours in, and I'm still being amazed by this. Don't think it might be too late to play this game, cause FromSoft still hasn't released a DLC. But with everything good, there is always bad.....   Jesus, From really needs to stop making random "poison" lakes, or in this one, the forsaken Lake of Rot. Go get Flame Cleanse me, and honestly to be true, it wouldn't be a souls game without one bad area. Actually that's not the only Hell you are going to go through. It's nice that they outsourced to religious figures, because the Subterranean-Shunning Grounds were made by Satan. Now I see myself as a idiot, but when we got to the very funny troll parkour that would lead to the Three Fingers, it made me so happy. I was constantly trying to not hurl myself off the Golden Gate Bridge, and honestly please FromSoft, it was very funny in the end when I figured out that I just had to "Git Gud" like everyone else was telling me. But one more hell....... MALENIA!!!!! I'm gonna say the truth, many guides online told me stuff, but ultimately, just why. It's a GOD-DAMN SEKIRO BOSS??? Man this is one middle-finger to every From enjoyer, because along with no Bloodborne PC Port after 7 F****** Years, we also get given a boss from Sekiro, which didn't get a DLC.  Lore is always an iffy subject in From-Soft games, because we have Youtubers that finish the job George R. R. Martin couldn't. The Only Thing I Know For Real though is that we should not have to figure out this sh** ourselves, and ultimately, my head hurts after trying to figure out why the worst bosses (Foreskin Duo) is repeated at least 3 times (separately or not). I get it, its a large game, you are gonna have to re-use bosses, but please. Godefroy (Godrick reskin) Two Godfrey and Loretta boss battles, and the same for Mohg and Margit (Not counting Morgott). At least Placidusax was cool. Would cry myself to sleep again over trying to figure out why I still suck at the game.   Even after all the hatred written in this message for some parts, 10/10 game, would uninstall and go pull maidens IRL if I could, unfortunately this game probably stole all my rizz. Anyway please, anyone else wants a Bloodborne PC port? From please, I'm on my knees, begging, just give us the port........ maybe within this century??? (Please I will be happy)
This game is absolutely fantastic, created by wonderful people, and given a beautiful reputation by the community. Difficult and unforgiving, but not unplayable like other Soul games sometimes were. Also, Ranni is best girl and I will fight you if you say otherwise.
Favorite game of all time.
I'm too old and too slow.  If you're not a hack and slash fan and you are drawn in by the beauty and the open world setting, let this be a warning to you.  Don't.  It is beautiful, its just too damn hard for this Souls Like Newbie.
absolutely incredible experience,. anyone who enjoys games should enjoy this masterpiece
this game is difficult... but also rewarding, fun, and beautiful
Reminds me of Everquest corpse runs. 10/10
yes
It's like Dark Souls with jumping, sneaking, and horse riding in a giant open world. It's incredible
First game I've played by FromSoftware and I want more! Great fun, even with all the deaths
w game
I haven't seen the sun in days and I think I have developed Stockholm syndrome. Decent game.
Game good.
nope, dont like it. rather insert random objects into my ass #DLGBump
Recommend playing most Fromsoft titles. All are worth trying.
THE most video game of all time   (seriously, a modern day classic, tarnished for the test of time)
Blaidd my beloved
This is the game of the decade and the best open world RPG that has ever been made.  Why haven't you bought it yet?    >It's hard  git gud
its alright 
Holy crap are the bosses so annoying to fight. Call me a scrub if you want but I've played Dark Souls 1-3 and I can't believe how much stupid crap the bosses throw at you. The older games had some stupid fights but almost every boss fight I've done so far in Elden Ring just feels tedious and annoying. Obviously a lot of work went into this game but I just can't recommend it if you want to have fun. I'll probably finish out the game but I don't see myself replaying this one as I did with Dark Souls 3 so many times.
cool
pve is amazing one of the best i have ever played but pvp is the worst gamemode in video game history i would rather have my balls stomped on 600 times per hour while i gargel on spiders and scorpions  that are stabing me with poison that doesent kill me but hurts alot 
its hard but good very good
its super hard but a good game
Probably one of the best games I've ever played. Despite filling me with so much rage, I'll never get back the experience I got playing this for the first time in its entirety. I don't think a single game in history had gotten as much hype as Elden Ring pre and post-release, and it's super nice to see that people are still exploring and making Elden Ring content.
I only recommend this game for it's adventure; exploration and beauty is unparalleled and cannot match any other soulslike.   However, it's combat is simultaneously a repeat of old soulslikes but done in the worst way possible. The beauty of the soulslike combat system was one-on-one combat: attack, dodge, and parry. Keeping perfect time and rhythm. This game doesn't have rhythm or timing. Just constant barrages of attacks from every single enemy barring the largest and most awkward. You will feel under pressure every second but never a chance to retaliate except for only in the most minute openings.   From Software's games have certainly felt the pressure of being "Difficult" and are being pressed to take it's formula and press it to it's logical maxima until it no longer resembles the original. These enemies and bosses do not feel like they are from the original or from any soulslike that has come out since, but enemies from non soulslike games. Games where the player should be able to return with equal force, but never can because they feel like they themselves are ripped from DS1.  This game will never reach the infamy of DS2 but so many encounters encompass what made that game more frustrating than fun: ambushes and memorization. Great hard games test reaction times not memorization, like the difference between the first and second Halo Legendary campaigns: where the second involved little reaction and plenty of memory after first failing many many times, the first always presented you with tests of skill for things you've previously gone through, clearly presenting the danger up front and allowing thought for your next moves for every encounter. The first Halo respected the player and wanted them to win, it understood it was a game and while it challenged the player it did not provide a wall that required narrow windows and laugh at you for not finding them. Elden Ring feels like the Dungeon Master that hated their players, the teacher that wanted you to fail, or the backstabbing friend that never was on your side.  If this was not a game then I would recommend it beyond exploring, if learning software engineering was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if learning art was a game I wouldn't recommend it, if being alive was a game I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't matter how hard the anything is, you will eventually get good enough at to beat it. When people complain about souls games, they're not having fun. Its not because it's hard.  TL;DR/Bottom Line: The game is only kind of fun, but if every hobby, and almost every other game bores you, then you may find this game thoroughly fun after the exploration runs out.
I got all the achievements (without using too many summons) , I'm only 13 years old and this is my first souls game. If you persevere the game is simple.
Good production value, but not fun to play.
pain
Original bought on console and the after beating it several times i transitioned to PC to have fun with the mods. It was GOTY, sold over 20 million copies, gave the player freedom to choose how to tackle the game in general and the challenge that comes along with it, can't go wrong with it.
my save file corrupted
This is a 10/10 - I still come back to this game after 650+ hours. I don't have anything bad to say about it, if they made endless DLC's I would play all of them.
Having played Dark souls 1 and 2 I can only say that I love this game. There is just SO much to explore.
This games is one of the best ive ever played. its said to be the most accsesable souls game  / souls like and i agree. It is quite the challenge but isnt too overbearing. the open world is amazing and filled with things to do. I have 60 more hours on this game on my ps4 and bought it here because i wanted to play it with my friends on pc and didn't want to pay for play station plus constantly. That, and the fact that my pc cant run the game very well are my only complaints about this game, and nether of them are a direct fault of the game asides from not being cross-play. 9/10 TL:DR challenging game with lots to do, many builds to make, and hidden lore.. Also good luck with maliketh.
This game is my first from software game and I love it - apparently I am a glutton for punishment. :)
I'm putting "Elden Lord" on my resume.
That shit smell like blight town bog fart ass
OH GOD WHY IS THE BOSS MUSIC STILL PLAYING
Very hard. Much pain. Very hard.
God Teir
I've put 24 hours into this game in the last 3 days someone help me
Peak Video Game
Very Pretty and Not super hard but hard.
anal rape but fun
 game absolutely tanks towards the end and is very front heavy, absolute masterpiece early to midgame. by the time you get to endgame there are very few new bosses (majority either reskins of earlier ones or 2 earlier ones combined into a duo that dont mesh together at all, the game gets a lot more linear with less interesting places to just come across and the balancing even at the recommended level is just not good.  the leveling system is terrible. find a new area? too bad because all of the enemies are 50 levels above you. sort of defeats the whole point of exploration no? once you remember that place and choose to go back youre extremely overleveled and kill everything in 1-2 hits including bosses.   very overrated 10/10 until caelid where it gradually drops until eventually landing on a 7.  dont bother finishing it just play until leyndell and start a new save.  Neon white and SIfu sadly clear.
RANNI!!!
Nice.
Fun
Meow
nigga
still dying ebery 20 minutes 200 hours in   10/10
sword
Such a fun game, about to start ng+ (i dont actually have 265 hours its more like 100), but this is easily one of my favorite games ever and i cant wait for a dlc
"...."
the difficulty curve at the beginning was the only issue i had compared to the other souls games but once you get used to it it becomes a very fun and challenging experience.
I hate this game with every fiber of my being. I cant seem to understand the stats and the armor ratings and what not nor do I understand the item traits. Im also horrible at the fighting, combat is very hard. Its a souls game i got what i payed for. Not having any prior game experience in the souls game i am obv going to be bad at it but ill keep trying.
am i crazy for thinking demons souls is better
I hate myself
si
its fun bit of a learning curve but its fun nonetheless and if your worried about the difficulty there are plenty of things to ease fights as long as you explore
I put 80 hours into my first play-through on PlayStation. Full of secrets to uncover and challenges to conquer. Has the thrill of exploration that Breath of the Wild gives you, with the challenge of a souls game. 10/10
10/10
W FromSoftware
cool game
Great game
absolute banger, 100 hours in and still finding new things
Just Awsome
There's no wonder why it's GOTY 2022. Fantastic game.
Amazing replay-ability
An Excellent experience!!!!
goated game
Elden John my beloved
Fromsoft games are usually always amazing, this game is no exception. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played.
cool game
Best souls Game
its like coke but costs more and gives you depression
Best game ever!
Challenging, exiting, content filled, beautifully made. Masterpiece.
git gud
Damn its fucking old school someone have to stop them of doing somethings that old this is so boring as hell.
Do I need to say anything. 10/10
Man i love this game, i makes me feel like a real man when i grab the Tree Sentinel balls on ng+1 and then just tear them off.
A truly fantastic open world Fromsoft game. With almost no cutscenes, the game manages to tell a fantastic narrative by placing items, enemies, NPCs, designs, and the landscape itself in areas that have importance to their locations. Beautifully designed and intelligently connected, the world will leave any player mystified.  The game play is another rhythm game, learn how the enemy fights and one can become untouchable. While being easier than other Fromsoft games, Elden Ring enemies will have quite a few tricks up their sleeves to give Souls-like veterans a skill check.  This game does not run at 60fps consistently even on medium graphics with good parts, but runs around 50 in group fights and 60 during boss fights
this game fucking pisses me off. worth every penny
shits fire
good game, great even
Too short
horrible game big thumbs down
This game is awesome!!!
It's so hard, every second of it is my own personal hell. I can't stop thinking about it. GOTY every year.
good strey hard but fun
PET THE POPE DOG
Emboldened by the flame of ambition, FromSoftware created an aesthetic masterpiece
i hate the dog 10/10
Once you get past the immense learning curve and difficulty it's an incredible game.
I am Malenia Blade of Miquella
i am terrible at this game
Truly deserved GOTY and im loving my second playthrough
Rather dissapointed with this game and it was not was I was expecting. Sure the game is said to be difficult, but I don't like the way the game throws you in the deep end and says "crack on then" with no real explanation of goal other than vague things like "get the Elden Ring..."  I'm not a hardcore gamer and don't have the time to play too much so the idea of dying multiple times to learn the combos and dodge jump roll attack repeat just does not appeal to me.   At the moment this is just not an enjoyable experience and I'm finding it rather frustrating.  If I could refund this game I would, unfortunately Steam only gives a 2hr window, so I'm stuck with it so I guess  I'll have to keep persevering with it, maybe I'll change my mind.
Game was really easy. I think I should move on to bigger and better things. (pursuing professional roblox map creation)
v good
very ebic
Overall the game is amazing, graphics are top notch, gameplay smooth and fun and a lot of customisation for your character (such as classes, weapons, spells, etc) but you can also pretty much choose to be anything as long as you keep leveling. Story is good and the fact that you're being called ''maidenless'' at the beginning is funny. The only down side of the game unfortunately is the coop. It's pretty horrible because if you plan to play it with your mates, it's pretty hard. While I was doing a boss (The rider near the church at the beginning), I was almost killing the boss and dodged him extremely well and played good, however me and my mate got invaded by some high level player and pretty much healed the boss with half hp). Yes you heard it right, not only the invaders are not being targeted by the mobs, but they can also use the bosses to easily kill you. For a new player that's pretty discouraging for them to even make em try to touch coop, considering that's the best part about a multiplayer, especially a souls game. If you plan on playing this on coop, I'd suggest another game like Nioh 1 or 2. It's a souls game and it may not be the same style as this one but it has amazing coop and I highly recommend that one too. I was going to give Elden Ring a 10/10 but due to this coop problem which is honestly pretty unfortunate, I give it an 8/10. Worth the shot.
I couldnt get around to playing it and now it just crashes when i try to start it, even after checking files and reinstalling
cool
Show me on the bloodstain where the boss touched you
Ah shit, here we go again.
Elden Ring is a good game but it’s so overrated and not GOTY worthy. This has to be my LEAST favorite souls like game fromsoft made beside dark souls 2. I enjoyed all other fromsoft games. To me the open world is and the unoriginal bosses is what ruined it. 95% of the bosses are really easy they are even easier than dark souls 2 bosses. Even Malenia which people claim is harder than bosses like Nameless king, Artorius, Midir ect isn’t as tough as people make it out to be. Also as you mentioned in the video the reused bosses, assets, and so movesets bothers me too. The open world really feels pointless and bland like in Ubisoft games. Souls like games works best as linear dungeon crawlers like the dark souls games. Or semi open world like sekiro. During my first run I did an all bosses playthrough I just keep stopping to play other things since I found the bosses in this game so boring and easy compared to the other souls games. But 1 thing for sure is whenever I play the game again, I CANNOT bring myself to do any of the optional bosses again whereas in every other souls like game fromsoft made I do every bit of content available. I’m glad fromsoft are taking a break from souls likes games to do armor core. This game feels more like they are milking souls like.
10/10  This game is hands down one of the best arpgs on the market and the best fromsoftware game to date. The map never ends!
too easy
Finally beat the first two story bosses (there are 14)
Amazing game (if your PC can run it)
good game
Most games are rollercoaster rides that guide you from one point to the next while trying to keep your attention through exposition that rarely amounts to anything more than popcorn. While there is nothing wrong with that and said games can provide entertainment, the overall experience tends to be forgettable.   Elden Ring takes the established Souls formula and puts it in a Zelda like open world. After 500+ hours I still find new stuff, uncover dialogue with NPCs, etc. While all the elements to keep you entertained for hours upon hours are there, there is also a lot more. It's like a digital painting, a work of art. From the colour palette to the music. Even though the world is a bleak, surreal and dreamy nothing feels out of place. Every item, NPC, piece of dialogue feels like it belongs there for a reason. This unfortunately isn't always true for the side content, which is one of drawbacks of an open world.  The obvious shortcomings of an open world game are easily overlooked by the overall experience that is present here. It makes the Souls formula accessible to a larger mainstream audience without handicapping the experience or the artistic narrative. Elden Ring will undoubtedly go down as a masterpiece along fondly remembered titles like Grim Fandango or Deus Ex.
Master piece
Fantastic game with high difficulty yet almost always fair, nearly unlimited options for what to do with your character. If I had to play one game for the rest of my life this would probably be the one

GOod 
Just met a cute girl in this game, she was just amazing, she took care of me, gifted me things and everything seemed perfect, but unfortunately later she killed herself and sat a big tree on fire. why all girls i like are so mad
best game
dark souls sucks but that game's pretty good
First off, crouching and then Let there be dung.
300 hours doing nothing but walking around 9.9/10 lacks more walking
It's aight
It's open world and dark souls but easier. That's about it. 7/10 pretty good.
pope turtle boy and jar man
One of the best games if you like Soulsborne games
I am Malenia Blade of Miquella
I still Suck.
Absolutely gorgeous ... enormous world, challenging and fun!
G-good game "Blushes" UwU
Best game of all time. Also, Malenia is hot.
10 at a 10 game :)
took me a year, but I've finally finished my first playthrough today. And I sure will do at least another one. so much to discover, every corner tells a story.
Addictive Game But fun
gut game 10/10
good
Easiest game I've ever played in my life.
One of the best games ever
Elden Ring is the Dark Souls of video games
def worth playing 
Oh, you don't have the right, oh, you don't have the right, oh, you don't have the right, oh, you don't have the right!
Women hot.
Masterpiece, truly game of the year. Too easy when you play with friends & great adventure.
very fun only downside is that you cant play with friends because high level players raid you and kill you both and reset progress
cool, but Dark Souls 3 is much better.  Also, the Game crashes more then female drivers. Fix your damn game Miyazaki.
A unique experience. Masterpiece!
game hay lam <3
THIS GAME IS FUCKING AWESOME
Good Game
Pretty damn dope
Live fast keep dying
This game simply shows how much love and hard work the devs have put in. I have played a lot of games and admired the craft put in them. But Elden Ring stands out from all of those. Initially when I started playing, seeing the map, I thought how can the world be so small. Little did I know that it was just a small part of the entire world. As I progressed through the game, I realized each area is distinct and very well made. The eerie feeling in dark dungeons and thinking that a strong enemy may sprung out of the dark any moment keeps you on your toes all the time. There are a lot of variations in enemies and the boss designs are of different level entirely.   I find most games that have a playtime of 10-20 hours are very detailed. But creating such a huge world and taking into account each and every detail is very impressive. Never did I encounter any bug as well. This game is well worth the money spent and even more.   I conclude that this is the best game I have ever played (keeping into mind RDR2 and KCD)
There is nothing more to add. Everything is already stated. This game is a solid 10/10 despite all it's imperfections.  Design is so fucking good, you visit places you couldn't even dream and face enemies straight from your nightmares.  I warn you, this game is very addictive and you can do things you never thought you'd do, like hugging girls.   Controls are a vast improvement compared to other souls games but still primitive, though that's on purpose.  Last, as always your biggest enemy is camera angles.
It is a good damn mastapiece
If you love the thrill of adventure and have a hard head like a coconut you will love this game.
awesome game, no more no less, just awesome.
"Let Chaos Take The World"
you can get hugs from woman
Try Finger, But Hole
NIHIL NIHIL NIHIL
It really is the game of the year. I did disagree with it before I played it, but I can definitely say now, it's an awesome game.
this game infuriated me to no end, don't try it unless you want to have a great time
am a silly guy playing a scrumptious game
One of the best games I've ever played!
Dope
The best game I've ever played period. 
pretty good ngl
I married a doll, PRETTY GOOD, GAME OF THE YEARRRR.... ELDEN RINGGGG!!!!

liam still hasnt killed the first boss
I normally do not enjoy SoulsBorne style games. I got halfway through DS1 then quit. I got through the tutorial in DS3 then quit. I absolutely love Elden Ring, I'm currently near the end of NG+2, aiming for that final ending achievement. I find this one is a lot more forgiving than the others, and all the more enjoyable for it.  Behold, Dog!
I'm stuck at fighting the masked man
honestly i kinda hated how much people were hyping this up and now i hate myself for not playing it sooner best game i have played easily nothing in this game is bad its just all good.
Best game in the last decade
not enough waifus for a dating sim
Generational game. Masterful in all aspects.
I've given this game too much time, it's not good. It's a bad game, and a worse Souls game
theres a spirit touching the "area" of every statue in the game and a dogmatic "dog-ship" of all the tortoises around the world, i recommend
The world is beautiful to see, the bosses are unbalanced but it does match the mythos of the world its difficult yes and maybe not for everyone but for people willing to have patience and learn from their mistakes and the mistakes of those around them they will become true elden lords before long. Explore, Strengthen yourself, learn and destroy those who stand in your path. This is the best advice i can give you should you choose to play.
awwww yeah. my game worked on ym compueter. very good. some difficult battles. and also, half trhe map i havent explored yet and dont know how. but very good.
elden rang
fuck im addicted
Dog funny
very good , happy chemicals go boom when you kill big bad guy
👍
overhyped, but solid game if you're a fan of FromSoftware games. beautiful soundtrack if you're into osts from video games. overall it's just Dark souls 3 with an open world and some changes not that it's a bad thing, but idk I felt like that held the game back a bit.
Game.
yay
Lost all of my soul playing this game.
This game is so incredible ya ^^
Somber; Mist outside. It falls with quiet beauty. Unforeseen Comfort....  
great experience, especially with seamless co-op mod.
easy game malenia is overhyped
*Mostly* marking this "not recommended" because valve can't understand the concept of nuance.  Overall, it's a Soulsborne game, so I like it. However there are enough issues with it that any of the other Soulsborne games are just more fun.  undodgable attacks, hit boxes worse than DS1 (by some miraculous feat), being able to get hit by basic attacks while you're lying on the ground unable to move, and Fromsoft nerfing mimics to the point of them being basically useless are the main issues.  The world looks really great and getting to explore it for the first time is really nice, but that kinda wears off after the first play-through.
I like alot, hard and good but fimn
Definitely a game
yeah

Maidenless behavior
GET 
Decided to give the game a try because I genuinely wanted to know what it was like to play in a fantasy world like this. Did not disappoint. I'm a full-blown keyboard and mouse player, and this game feels just fine with the controls that it gives me. Despite being incredibly difficult to learn, lose and master mechanics, it is genuinely some of the hardest fun I experience.  First Souls-like game I have ever played.
Awesome game!
Try fingers, but hole.
the best game iv ever played
Look I get it, ya'll like getting your asses beat into submission millions of times and I should of known better when I was buying the game.  I am big into story and Its kind of hard to enjoy a story when I'm taking it up the rear every 5 seconds.  I don't have the time it would require to "get good" at this game or the patience.  I know its a Souls-like game, but it would be cool if there was a way to enjoy the story without having to suffer.  Like making an easier mode for casual gamers then having the intended experience for everyone else.
margits feet smell nice
:)
yes
who ever made the horse guy hope you get monkey aids
It’s alright I guess
Good god this game is a masterpiece. I have played it pretty much nonstop since I got it almost every free moment I have (I am writing this as I play). The only reason I wouldnt recommend it is its addicting. This is my first souls game and very rarely do I have issues with it.  Pros: Hours of side content Rich environmental and lore storytelling Interesting characters Open world and a non-linear experience letting you go at your own pace Bosses are usually pretty fun and unique, even ones that reoccur as normal enemies later as it is incredibly satisfying to fight something as a boss and come back and beat it to a pulp as a regular enemy Bosses are rarely unfair and it usually feels like your fault for dying either by being under leveled or unskilled Speaking of being underlevel, leveling and power leveling to make fights easier is completely viable and legitimate way to play Tons of secrets to explore and find granting new rewards Cons: Its a souls game, if you rage easy its not for you Early game is brutal and hard and basically requires some grind or incredible skill Camera can be buggy getting stuck and spinning with lock on Lock on can fuck you as often as it helps you by randomly switching targets or body parts from slight mouse movements making you miss or get stuck Horse combat can trivialize fights Attacking with colossal weapons is sluggish but also seems to eat inputs meaning mashing can make you commit to extra attacks and take damage When a something DOES feel unfair it feels EXTREMELY UNFAIR. (For me it was putting a magma wyrm in a tiny arena where it can basically take up the entire stage with one move it likes to spam that leaves lingering magma) Some puzzles are insanely complex, almost requiring a video making blind playthroughs hard Jumping and falling on someone COUNTS AS AN ATTACK and will make them hostile or OUTRIGHT KILL some characters, which can lock you out of some quests and even endings, This can be fixed with a specific item at a specific place but the location is never revealed or explained until you randomly find it. Scaling feels wonky, and some enemies will seem overly tanky despite being much weaker previously, or youll come back after a few levels and theyll be a joke Overall though I would definitely recommend this game. I will be going for a second play through to go for other endings!
Yes
 hit bad guy "THONK" "SLICE" "WAPAOW" :thubms uip:
big
very good game im trash at it tho(rune farms go brr) 
The wolf man is very hot
Me personally i think this is one of the greatest souls games to ever grace this universe of multiverses. And I think the boss named radagon and godskin duo should not exist!
best
First off grass!
I have just beat the game and playing through was very fun although at some points it was very maddening. I would recommend this game 1000% (that was not a typo). The cut scenes are also really cool. Even after completing the game there are like 5 other endings to get and so much more for me to do in the lands between.
too hard 10/10
THIS GAME MAKES MY WEINER FEEL AWSOM :D
This game has been out for a year now and Ive only had this game for 2 weeks and Ive played dark souls before but this game is exeptional it is huge and theres always something to do the game feels endless you can do so much in elden ring by far one of the best games of all time in my book.Although it can be tough at time theres always way to get around obsticles its not limited to a certain play style you can do anything and combined with mods from nexus mods this game is virtually endless it takes me back to when I was a kid playing skyrim where every time I logged onto the game There was always a new quest or adventure waiting for me. 10/10 I can see why this game won game of the year.
You don't have the right, O you don't have the right, by the way you don't have the right, O you don't have the right
peak ahh game, ranni bad as hell 
 i hate this game five out of five stares though
soooo gooooooooooooooooood
I've never played a souls game and I almost quit this one before I actually learned the mechanics, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I've beat the game a handful of times and still love playing it just because of how many different builds and paths you can take to beat it. 11/10 recommend this to anyone who wants a very in-depth open world game that is actually challenging.
Got maidens
skill issue tbh
Yes
Game bad after 93 hours on steam (100 something) on xbox I can find no real reason to play this game. The boss fights are super lame and not intricate with several phases and good music but the replay-ability is shot because of the hundreds of different builds and online multiplayer coop that is like dark souls but better. I cant be the only one who finds no intrests in diving into an open world with loads of character and fun exploration, with fair but challenging and rewarding game play?  Only play this game if you enjoy bad games. Your money is better spent on good games like BattleField 2042 and Fortnite.
Help
Lived up to the Souls game legacy in explosive fashion!
gonna punch a hole threw  my monitor fun game tho 
Fun Game
Good But No Robot Sex
if you like being stomped on and like feeling small THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU
Praise the sun!
I love this game.
this game cool
This game is Space Ace for the 2020s.    Through trial and error figure out the combo of block, roll, little hit, big hit, roll, rinse repeat.  Finally beat bad guy.   Next screen, new bad guy.   Figure out new combo on up down left right.   Beat guy,  New screen, rinse repeat.     Sorry those that love this genre, but this is just lame.   I've been playing games for over 40 years, and this game reminds me of those crappy early games that were simple memorize the combo games, that threw in randomness to just make them unfair.    I've beaten many games on hard/insane level but this one takes the biscuit. The only Souls-like game that actually has combat where you can plot your way through a mixed group of bad guys is Jedi Fallen order.    For all those who will call me a troll, answer this question.   Did you get through this game without dying 500+ times???   If not, then this game is pure luck.....The only people that can claim to be "gud" at this game are those that went all the way through without dying once.    The rest just spammed your way through. The only thing that would make this game bearable is to be able to save it when I want to, like just before the locked door you know insta-death is waiting behind.........but Nooooooo, I have to die coz my perfectly timed counter just missed and I'm dead, so I have to wait 15 seconds for the reload then battle my way through the same axe fodder for 10 mins, to get back to the "boss" to then watch and learn their moves, oops, lag, missed roll or missed counter......dead......rinse repeat.   jeez.   Is this gaming?
I like rolling and blocking
It would sure be a shame if I didn't recommend it after 800+ hours
I wish Mods were easier to use cause this sh*t is rocket science to download. But amazing perfect game otherwise.
Yeah this game slaps
Dark Souls I Guess?
Time for pickle
I have never found a game that I suck so much at that I cannot help trying again and again. I have never rage quit a game more times only to just come right back to the game. 10/10 love it a lot.
The game is amazing but i wouldn't recommend buying it on steam- or pc for that matter. Its performance is horrible on PC and for me it made the game genuinely unplayable. I love this game and I hope they truly focus on their PC port soon.
good game
Elden Ring is game. In fact, it might actually be best game. It is all things game. Instant classic, this will be remembered for many years to come. Absolutely legendary.
Best yet
For lack of a better word, because no amount of words can describe this game, Peak.
pain and hate
One of the best games I ever played
It's a good game. The combat is generally smooth. The world looks amazing. The characters are great. the story while sometimes hard to find is well thought out. I would appreciate some level of guidence, mostly just a list of started quest names, so i can remember who i talked to, but even with out it the quests are ok. Over all its a stunning game worthy of a golden throne.
Take DS3 and add large swatches of negative open space that do nothing but bore you, open world is bland, empty and boring.  Downgrade from DS3, needs better well thought out area's instead of wide open area's with nothing of interest.  Disappointing over hyped game, worse than it's predecessor and other games in the same genre.
its def a good game that i rarely play
i suck
as long as you dont mind hair ripping frustration
Took some time getting used to how strong every weapon is in the game because of the skill arts, but overall the game is fantastic and I wouldn't expect less.
I mean the game is not bad. I have 100 hours in it BUT I do feel somewhat robbed. There is a lot to do in this game, even tough much of it is very frustrating. There is nothing which I would call exceptionally good about this game, but it mostly is always good to very good. Except in two regards. Graphics is really not that great. Its a large map, but for a AAA title its not good enough. But far far far worse is the Story/Storytelling in this game. I played 100h and I still dont know why we do any of the things we do. The player wants to become the elden lord, but why? What is the elden lord? Why is this world so dark? What is the erd tree? You can be extremely happy if you get a vague answer to any question in this game. The story writers were so lazy it ruined the game for me. I just really dont feel any motivation to play on, because why should I? It feels like doing the same all over again without any purpose. And I cant even imagine any excuse to writing such a horrednous story other than lazyness.
Is she Malenia? Yes.  Is she the Blade of Miquella? Yes.  Will I remember this? Also yes.  10/10
Big wow, very fun, exciting challenge (until you git gud) , love the views, Raya Lucaria gang.
Ahh yes, the journey began as a young hollow - the Lords are no longer  NG ?
yes
Elden lean. go forth and smash, or be smashed. but always go back to smash back.
Absolute DOGWATER of a Game. Would never recommend.
this game is very easy!?
Is supa Gud
Game Good, Hard but Fun
10/10 it really this game deserve the title game of the year. its like any other souls game but it is Very open world with plenty to do and amazing graphics and scenery of this world just beautiful. everything is hard but rewarding once you beat an enemy.  Amazing all around

One year later and it's still in my SSD.
Nice game Too expensive though, get it when it's on discount.
When I die I wish to be reborn as a little crab in this game
If you value your sanity, do not buy this game.
If you are looking for an epic masterpiece of exploration and rpg elements, this is the game. There are moments in this game that will genuinely change your view on gaming.  It will test your patience, but it will reward your persistence. Remember, it's not just your character leveling up, it's you getting better that makes you stronger in this game.  It won GoTY for a reason. This game is awesome.
lord of blood can suck my nuts
Lots of fun. It is a Dark Souls game.  Not easy but rewarding gameplay.

oh god
Its pretty cool
play this now
If you are still looking at reviews for this game, then you already know you want it.  Go for it!
elden ring is a very fun game and you can spend so much with out knowing but is very diffacut if you have not played a souls game
i love this game i fucking love it  i love it  i love big ass boobs and bitches with fat asses
it doesnt really tell you any thing about the story or how your stats work you just go in and the game does its best to beat your face in. the feeling of defeating a boss or getting past something super difficult is second to none, truly amazing game i have loved it from the start. not having played dark souls i had no idea what i was getting in to. but its been a blast 10/10 
game good
Garbage game. Not worth playing
good game
I recommend this game based entirely on the fact it is a solid, well made game, that should be enjoyable for a few people, not for others.  But make no mistake, absolutely overrated, just a re-skinned dark souls with a few new features that were probably thought of by one of the designers while taking a shit or having a wank or something.  Re-skinned enemies from previous games.  Same old gameplay, gets a bit stale, same shit different type of corn inside.  Personally for me the open world aspect only served to make the game more tedious than souls games usually are, I ended up getting "souls fatigue" about a quarter into the game, as the start of it is honestly quite dull overall.   Not actually sure why this got GOTY, isn't that award just a popularity contest nowadays anyway?   But other than that, sure yeah it's objectively fine I've no reason to not recommend it, have fun playing Dark souls 4 open world edition.
I have funny red spin sword
yes
My self is new to games like Elden Ring, I have never played the dark souls games but I am planning to. No wonder why this game got game of the year, all though you do need skill to be able to play this game or simply put in time to get good. It is really fun and has really engaging combat, it has a huge map but lost graces helps you with that, you can also play with your friends. If you have played any of the dark soul's games you will 100% enjoy this game. Have fun ;)
I love it....
Smash
cant sex ranni :(
10/10 Goomba Stomped Morgott's corpse in the Elden Throne into the ground.
great game
You need to restore the Elden Ring, it's very important, it's a matter of the utmost urgency, you have to restore it, restore the fucking elden ring ok ? Don't ask why or how just fucking do it ok ? Do it ! DO IT RESTORE THE ELDER NING FFS
You always have another chance at dying
Don't go after Margit early on if you're new to the game. He exists to say "I'm going to be mean to you until you go explore the world." Once you get past that hurdle, the game expands and there are a lot of interesting places to explore. Like Dark Souls 1, there's a definite point where things start feeling less polished, but I'm hoping we get a Elden Ring: Scholar of the First Sin equivalent to go over the rough patches.   NPC quests are cryptic, quests in general have kind of subpar signposting, it's possible to get lost for 20 hours and come up with nothing but more questions. It's up to you whether that's good or not.
It's the newest Dark Souls. This game has a huge number of PvP balance issues, but PvP has always been nightmarish in this game series, so it doesn't bug me. There are noob friendly weapons in the game that will help someone wanting to experience the PvE arc without actual danger, but if you're a legit Dark Souls original player then you can choose not to use those. It's From Software's latest opus and this series will remain legendary for years to come.
Very good game :)
GARBAGE

Fun game to play even when dogs are everywhere, get past the hard and enjoy it.
fantastic game! good job:)
I hate the ginger man
This game made gaming fun again.   The story was captivating and game play was smooth.
One of the best games I've ever played hands down
Incredible game. FromSoftware knows how to make a game. This is my second Souls game and I put it personally below Dark Souls: REMASTERED. I think FromSoftware did an admirable job making an expansive open world, but personally found it to fall into the same pitfalls as any other open world game: repetition, boring caves, etc. I think it is better done than most, but it would have been a much better experience if it was more like Bloodborne or Dark Souls.   My personal gripe is that despite the game rendering 21:9, it puts vertical black bars over the sides to force it to 16:9. I would beg FromSoftware to fix this. There is no reason to do this when the game obviously supports it. I have loaded into the game several times and not have the black bars on the screen and it is everything I wanted.  All of that said, I would still absolutely recommend the game. 9.5/10
Actual masterpiece apart from the multiplayer.
Nice.
kool game
very fun game
" ... " - Goldmask
good game, worst developers I've ever seen though
gud
The most beautiful, enjoyable, wonderful yet insanely difficult and frustrating game I have EVER played. That is in 43 years of gaming. 1980- present. The satisfaction of killing bosses and finally beating the game was the most rewarding feeling that I have ever experienced from a video game.
finger butt hole
Makes me want to kill my self. 10/10
huff, finally I finished Limgrave, this year I'm gonna clear Liurnia Lake, wish me luck!

One of the best games I ever played!
You must play it
fffffffggtbtbrbb game
is good
w game, so hard tho 
so much copy pasted and half baked content everywhere. Character quests are the most obtuse they've ever been and can't be completed without a guide. Never know where I'm supposed to be going or doing. Easiest Souls game period. Bosses are uninspired and boring. Monotonous.
First souls like I've ever played and just decided to pick it up on a whim. It is tough but fair and keeps me wanting to try and learn. It is so rewarding when you finally get that great enemy down after dozens of tried. 10/10
Ok game
they rob people in south africa. +rep to this gamee

The Best game of 2022, No matter the price this is a must buy if you are into RPG's and exploring.
Nice
YOY

i love blaidd, i love greatsword, i love guts from berserk
FUN
Good
masterpiece
Definition of epic.
It was amazing
This game rose to my top 10 games in my library so quick. This game is awesome. Every play through can be the same level of fun if you choose to challenge yourself. Choosing a certain build and going through with it to the bitter end. I absolutely love this game. The graphics is great. The game play is awesome. It brought me back a couple years. Very good game this game will light up anybody's day up quick.
It's Dark Souls 4.  Positives: Dark Souls combat. Big world. Build creativity. Aesthetics.  Negatives: Too fast paced combat. I prefer the slower and more tactical combat in Dark Souls 1 and 2. Hard to read many of the bosses' attack moves. Horse gameplay feels too cheesy and out of place. The companion summon system (spirits can be used to aid you in boss fights) is not fullfilling.
2 holes in the wall and a sprained wrist 100% would do it again. 10/10
GotY
Just play it, it's good. 
GIVE ME DLC  EDIT: THEY LISTENED
I am Malenia Blade of Miquella  P.S Buff tanks please
maidenless 
If you like suffering play it
11/10
Really fun game. Nice graphics.
Is this game hard? Yes, but it is very rewarding!
Before I played Elden Ring I had no friends and no girlfriend. Now it hasn't changed but game is cool.
LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Really im just waiting for more dlc one of my most loved souls like games but if your new don't give up  
good enought to make me skip work  10/10 would recommend
worth your money
Donkey
input lag, ridiculous delay on attacks from bosses, generally poor boss and enemy design (stupidly easy or annoyingly hard - nothing in between) and also area/level design is bad in the later parts of the game (boss spam and HP sponges).   basically, many of the old flaws and poor design decisions from other fromsoft games are here, and worse, and less of the good parts are here. if it was well polished and smaller in scope (to actually be able to pace it well and give each area and boss the care they needed) it could've been an amazing game.
Its Geme
Git Gud bitches
Best game ever made
4 arm woman
Awe inspiring landscapes and visuals. Elden Ring is truly breathtaking.  What it lacks for in visual fidelity it makes up with the ambience and artstyle. It's Absolutely worth playing if you wanna get lost in a beautiful but dark fantasy souls-like game.  totally worth your money if you're a dark souls fan
This game sucks. I hate it and it's stupid that it's so popular.  *beats the boss* This is a masterpiece that should be a requirement to play.  That's the truth about this game. You will have so much pain, but that pain is only because you need to play it more to get better at it, learn the patterns, and come out victorious. This game is incredible, which you probably already knew.
Has a ton of little design choices that make it kind of meh. Better than your average game, but definitely inferior to DS3 on the whole, which it most closely resembles. Fine for a playthrough or two, but gets tedious, especially towards the end.
Have to restart a pc to get the HDR working on win11.  But the ammount of time trying to turn stuff on/off and try to make it work... and then just restarting the pc to actually fix it, left me with enough frustration to post this garbage review. Take my bitter review.
Prepare thy rump
Whatever you wish to play as, your wish is granted. A blade mage? Check! there's blade magic. A pyromancer? Check! A cryomancer, necromancer? Yes! If you want to snipe with a bow, you can. Want to carve people up with a pair of knives? Want to tank with heavy armor, a big shield, and a 12 foot spear? Are you a parry master? Do you like laughing maniacally while you run into a pack of enemies and suicide bomb the whole group? All of this can be done, but one thing that Elden Ring has the the Souls games don't: a Horse...i think... There aren't many builds in this game that I haven't done by this point, but a cavalry build is one I haven't tried. It's tough to do, since the horse cannot go into dungeons, but it's something I still want to try.  This game has now become my most played game in my library. It was incredibly fun, and I still find things that I never knew existed. Worth every penny.  On such a high note, I do have to say this. Co-op is HOT TRASH! I've always hated the summoning bs in the souls games.  GET SEAMLESS CO-OP IN NEXUS if you play with a friend. It will make your entire game play experience 10 times better because you don't have to deal with the whole crafting the item to summon your friend, summon your friend, wreck the boss or die, wash rinse repeat countless times.  If you have trouble with the pvp part of souls games, seamless co-op will also help. Because it doesn't mesh with the anticheat software that the game uses, it forces you to play offline, totally eliminating invasions.
Good
Long time not seeing a game like this, highly recommend!
It's just so . . . boring.  I played one of the souls games before through to the end, but this is entirely blah.  I really don't understand the appeal.  I've TRIED to enjoy this but I keep finding myself feeling more inclined to play literally anything else in the scant few hours I'm free to play games through the week.    I would rather have my money back.
Greate chest ahead! 
good
really cool and fun to play game. I died really often but i think you have to gut used to it
I was a wimp and a coward before ELDEN RING... but for only $89.95, my life improved significantly. I became smart, I got buff, I married the love of my life, and so much more. Bless FromSoftware Inc. and this game is the greatest $90 you could ever spend on Steam.
this game is fucking pain but the feeling when you kill the boss or finish this game is priceless
This game on release was piss easy. A year after its release it won GOTY and was defo the best game by far. Is still so easy, cattering to the braindead dumbfuck spell users who cheesed DS3. Dark souls 3 is better (I am defo coping)
Praise rump
once u get past marjit its the best experience of ur life
Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a video game. It has it all: intriguing story, stunning visuals, unique NPCs and best of all, incredible combat.   As an avid Bloodborne lover, good combat flow, and combat enjoyability is a must for me. One of the problems with most souls/soulslike games for me is when I beat a boss, I often feel a “ugh thank god that’s over with” feeling. I don’t get that victorious hell-yeah moment, I’m just glad it’s done and lowkey dreading the next boss that I come across. Elden Ring? Every boss fight is hard fought, but incredibly satisfying. The elation of taking down these gorgeously designed bosses is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before with any video game. It feels good to win. So good that I find myself constantly coming back to try new builds and new ways to challenge myself.   If you’re new to the souls genre, I almost want to recommend waiting to play this game till after you try something like Dark Souls. Elden Ring feels so vastly different, and superior in many quality-of-life ways that it feels almost unfair to compare it to most of its predecessors. With that being said, I can’t emphasize enough that this game is a must try.
Dearest Tarnished,   Come to the Lands Between,   With thy fiery ambition and strength,  Taketh the Great Rune from the Demigods,  Conquer the throne bequeath for a Lord,   And the Elden Ring shall answer thee.    
man what id do to play it all again
One of the best game I have ever played in my life.
Pretty Ok  10/10
Just got nuked literally from orbit by a guy who's way too large for his tiny pony.  10/10 would summon giant pots to fight cannibal giants again.
Elden Bling
fun but pain
It's good.
Amazing. The only downside is how addicting it is.
penis 
good game
Just buy the game, Valdemar
this game made my penis grow 7 inches, at first i had 2 inches but becayse of this beautiful game i now have a 9 inch penis that produces lots of seman 
ummm I should probably roll another Class..

Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but the game’s overall design makes it hard for me to openly recommend it.  Elden Ring is an open world combat RPG, where battling with enemies is the center of everything. There is a huge world to explore where you find various items, that help your character you make in the beginning to become stronger statistically, but everything you find centers on your combat capability of course, since this is not an adventure game. Albeit this approach, the game offers some impressive vistas throughout the world you explore, somewhat curious NPCs that talk to you and most importantly challenges in the form of varying enemies and boss battles. There are many places you can visit, also underground, which all help you, at the end of the day, to become stronger by giving you more runes, that are basically a currency you buy levels with at checkpoints.  If one is familiar with the developer’s, From Software, former titles, the risk reward mechanic is the same in here and the actual fighting mechanics are also the same as in Dark Souls games; you lose your runes when you die, but can retrieve them from your death spot, but lose them completely if you die again before that, and the fighting is basically careful observing of enemies while dodging (by rolling endlessly) and blocking.  The game is fun at the beginning, offering decent challenge, and at any point if you find the game too tough, which is likely, you can gain more levels by collecting runes for slaying enemies or simply exploring easier approachable areas. Since the game is very long in length due to the sheer size of the world, most players might wish to follow the main path straight to the end without much additional exploration, but alas, the game’s difficulty, even despite the help of a selectable phantom fighter (spirit ashes) who you can call in for help in tough spots, forces exploration to gain runes for the vast majority of players to overcome later tough enemies. This might not sound like an issue, since this applies to some other open world titles too, but the time it takes to explore to be strong enough is in tens of hours – I’m not exaggerating.  While the beginning is fun and quite exciting, the more you play the more repetition kicks in, even if the areas around the map are visually different, but enemies repeat and so do bosses; they use the same models. Even the overall quality of level design is better at the beginning, the Stormveil Castle being at least to me the most exciting place to see and explore, after that perhaps a few notable places existing in the game. This castle is at the very beginning and after that the quality slowly drops the further you get, endgame being very tough and a slog to get through, mostly due to some nasty bosses.  The bosses are a big part of the studio’s focus and they are admittedly often fun to fight, but in this game most bosses are annoyingly designed, scaling in damage too much from the very beginning till the end. This vast damage they tend to inflict in a single strike makes the game more a hectic rhythm based act to avoid the worst hits, while waiting patiently for an opening to strike pretty much freely when the enemy takes it’s pause. I find this limiting character building wise, since I’m sure the game is extremely hard without putting many skill points on vitality (max health) to sustain more damage.  The bosses also have cheap moves and combos, which often rightfully makes you feel like you die an unexpected and unfair death, but this is thankfully mitigated by the phantom helper that can take hits from enemies instead of you and even slightly damage them, so you can heal up on the side, perhaps cast a spell or incantation and prepare to strike again. So even if boss design is most often not as great as in previous games from the studio, especially compared to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, occasionally being even bad, the phantom helper is there for you making some bosses actually pretty trivial, which is not a bad thing if you don’t wish to be stuck on them in this - in my honest opinion - too long game.  I personally have explored almost everything in the world and I’m likely ”over leveled”, which would mean that in the main progression path I’m fighting enemies on a higher level than players usually are, but still, after playing so long, easily over 100 hours in fact, I’m still currently momentarily stuck at one mandatory very late game boss that, once again, has upped damage so that it can kill you in a short sweep of attacks. This fact is saddening to me, since the game has pretty fun exploration, the best yet character building in the studio’s history, amusing places to discover, and of course the action is intuitive and most often entertaining, but yet the game is enough of a slog to get through at many points and too repetitive. If you decide or rather need to explore much because of the difficulty that can spike, the game starts undoubtedly to feel overall as following: cheap. It is a cheap game in the end with talent and quality at many places, but filler content and bad design all over the place. This game should have been shorter in my opinion, or at least easy enough to complete quicker going straight through the main path, but for me - and I’m not a noob mind you since I have completed Dark Souls 1 and 3 and Sekiro, Elden Ring is simply too tough to my taste to call it enjoyable.  As a side note, I might find the game so hard due to a faith build, meaning I use incantations in the game that are slow to cast in the heat of a battle, but this fact just tarnishes the game even more, because it truly doesn’t allow too much freedom in building the character if you want to excel as care free as possible - which you want, trust me.  Now you might find this game fun and most players looking for combatting challenge will do at the beginning for a long while, but I label this review as negative due to the overall quality throughout the experience and the too cheap and frustrating challenge you will face eventually, no matter how good you are. If you are good, you will overcome the challenge, perhaps even quickly, but I doubt many of the fights are that fun in any case, unlike in Dark Souls 3 for example, where the game is thoroughly quite carefully designed, albeit unforgiving.  Consider this game if you are ready to face this disappointment I’m feeling here and in the case you are a fan of the studio’s previous work, but for many, you should think twice, remembering that this game is far from GOTY material like some might claim, because the quality is so varying. I think sound design and graphics should be better as well to call this a GOTY, since the tech is like a mix of last-gen and current-gen, leaning more on the last-gen.  Lastly about the mentioned technical side: The game runs decent enough if you have strong single core CPU performance and my RX 5700 XT plays it almost always at 60 FPS on max settings at 1440p, which the game is unfortunately capped at, but this hasn’t bothered me mentionably. There are areas that are bound to drop the framerate below 60 FPS, somewhere around 40 – 45, which is a slight annoyance, but those moments are rare. The game’s current version 1.08.1 is bug free, though it’s worth to mention that I experienced one freeze-up.  Enjoy, suffer, be numbed, overcome, that is the formula of Elden Ring. Take this as you wish.
Playing this for the second time and on the pc is amazing, even more better, amazing game anyone should try it, no one should miss this one.
It's a fun game and challenging game. I love to open world format.

Best open world game ever
Best Game i have played in my life. Im 64 years old, I started with pong back at the begining when Bill Gates And Steve Jobs were teenagers. Diablo was also a must have game . But Elden Ring is one of the Best , someone shouldnt miss it . It would be like if you never saw Star Wars , Big Mistake. I just hope they get some downloadable content thats worth while , and go to work on an Elden Ring 2.Thank You 
Falling made me die more times than any boss - 10/10
they added jumping
Time for crab
its like fortnite
good good
It's a masterpiece. GOTY for sure. It's a little hard, and definitely will not hold your hand or even tell you what to do. But if you stick with it, it's a very rewarding experience and it's one of my favorite games ever.
very enjoyable game but I wish they made the controls more user friendly or just added more shortcuts for items and such.
Very good game. 10/10
good
Do you like pain?                           Mommy? Sorry!
Beautiful game. I am a dark souls veteran and figured I would make this one a challenge. In dark souls 3 i challenged myself by taking a shot every time i die, needless to say i got pretty drunk LOL. This time i wanted to crank it up another level. I told myself i would break a law every time i died. well this game is harder than i thought it was going to be. at first breaking the laws started out easy. I did to the first boss, The Fell Omen, almost immediately so i had to break the law. I went outside and J walked, no problem. Then i died to the golden horse guy and had to break another law, i ended up holding up a 7/11 for 87 bucks. I got home and hopped back on to try again. I died almost immediately again to that horse guy and went out to break another law. I went to the bank and took a big loan under a fake identity and leased a boat to impress chicks at seacrets in OC. well the law caught up to me and i ended up spending a year in jail. i got back on the other day and finally beat the horse boss. its pretty cool
the rage is real
cool world but hard as shit
awsome
=)
i tried finger but hole and i liked it
everyone is racist towards tarnished 10/10
Of all the Souls-style games I've played, this one is by far my favorite. It takes all that I loved from DS1 and brings it into a far more accessible, far more flexible game. While it may lack the tight, compact world design of the older titles, I do really enjoy what the open world brings to the souls formula.
Pukimak la Hidetaka Miyazaki
Amazing! Worth the experience and NG++++ which is cool! Loads of styles, weapon, everything!
Great 5 stars
5/5 Apples if you use a controller.  1/5 Apples if you use a mouse and keyboard.
I can't stop
I can safely say that this game is amazing in all of the aspects that a game can be amazing at. Gameplay, graphics, the environment that all of it takes place in, cut scenes, even the small bits of lore that I managed to gather as I played these 80 hours, mobs/bosses visual and combat designs, the learning curve that you had to go through with each and every "creature" type so you can defeat it effectively and there are many other more features that I probably didn't even take advantage of, because to be honest 80 hours is not enough to get a taste of everything this game has to offer. But I have one objection to make...only one. Leonine Misbegotten. That piece of shit. That son of a bitch. That fucking pain in the ass of a boss. Don't get me wrong he is well designed and all, but I don't think I have ever hated a boss more than that ginger lion lookin' trash. All I hope for him is to choke on a huge bag of dicks daily from dawn to midnight. I fought Malenia and defeated her in 2 tries. I killed Placidusax first try. Rykard? Fucking owned his ass in the first phase and I even forgot to have the big sword equipped. And then the second try I didn't even bother to dodge. DEAD. But that asshole, he is something else. It took me about 6 to 7 hours to kill him. And once I did I was thrilled. I was over the fucking Moon. Now please imagine my surprise when I FOUND HIM AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE RADHAN, AND HE HAD COMPANY A FUCKING ANNOYING BITCH ASS KNIGHT. SO IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT I CANNOT KILL THE LEONIN BITCH BY HIMSELF BECAUSE MY BRAIN CANNOT COMPREHEND HIS MOVE SET, HE HAD AN ANNOYING IDIOT KNIGHT WITH A BIG SWORD AND A POINTY SHIELD TO STICK IT UP MY ASS. AND THE I FOUND HIM AGAIN IN LEYNDELL 2 TIMES. AND THEN AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE LORETTA AT ELPHAEL. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY MORE OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE THAT PIECE OF SHIT IS HIDING HOPING TO FIND ME!!!   Anyway rant over. 10/10 game I totally recommend it
Truly the Darksouls of open world games
Great game indeed. I can't stop playing it.
The real Elden Ring was the friends we made along the way
gud gam
great sword go brrrrrrrrrr
 Elden Ring, Oh Elden Ring. There is a line between a video game and an art masterpiece. Elden Ring is the masterpiece I have waited for my whole life. Try fingers, but hole.
HIM
if you want to get a carry through a boss fight just hire the stupidest looking player and they will most likely 3 shot the boss.
I fucking love this game.
Really great game.  But coop is very bad, like, really really bad, I really recommend to use the "seamless coop mod", really helps the experience
This game ruins my expectation. No other games will be as fun and I don't even know what's happening in this game. 100% worth the full price.   Advice for new players: Try finishing all of the dungeons in the region before fighting the region's boss and moving on to the next region. That way you'll be overleveled most of the time and will make the boss fight significantly easier.
First (and so far only) souls game to keep me hooked all the way through. Motivated me to go back and retry other games of the same genre.
THIS GAME IS ADDICTING
Das good 
Roll Roll Roll Roll
finger grant me but hole
shit slapps in a heavenly manner, I own this on pc and ps4 mainly played on ps4
It's alright I guess
the goat game
fun
Try it if you can overlook the obnoxious number of delayed attacks an enemy can have. It's just a cheap gimmick when an enemy has too many.
Ranni can smother me with her thighs
one of the best game i played even if the PVP is shit and mage players are the post pathetic ppls in the world
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHl, I WILL KILL THE GODS IF BLEED KILLS ME AGAIN, THY BLOODED SWORD SHALL NOT PIERCE THEE HIDE HIDEOUS BEAST OF BLOOD"  This is how I speak when I play this game, and yes it is a problem and the neighbors have complained. 10/10 would get noise complaint again
fun
fucking bullshit game... my grandmother learned how to use a smartphone quicker than i could learn the controlls to this game... asked for refund
Absolutely ruined my life, other games just aren't fun anymore.  One of the most amazing games I have ever played in my life!  When I first got the game I found it very difficult and was about to quit and then I started to get the hang of things, once I did it became extremely addictive, to the point I was going to bed at 4am just to wake up at 7am for work.  Although the game has caused frustration, and I keep taking breaks from it, something about it keeps drawing me back in.  I would 1,000% recommend you get this game; your mom, your dad, and even your grandma should play!!!
cool game
skill issue
Elden Ring is a good game, but i cant recommend it.  The game is beautiful, completely breathtaking at times, however this is a game for hardcore 'gamers' only. Even so, i have never felt anger like Elden Ring made me feel anger. The soundtrack is meh i don't get what everyone's talking about and the story was lost to me. Where this game shines is the satisfaction in FINALLY whooping the boss' ASS and getting that sweet new equipment to beat the next one, no matter how many times they knocked me down. I played through with my best friend, and i wouldn't trade the memories or experience for anything.  Only play if you want to be tested Mentally and Emotionally
almost punched my monitor, almost threw my controler, alot of rage gone out on my kids and wife (joke) but overall good game
A beautiful open world teeming with various and unique enemies.  After 30 hours, there is still so much to discover and do in this game.   Nothing feels stale or repetitive.  This is my first "Souls" game and I have to say, I am very impressed.

The game was really fun and had a really nicely constructed world. I liked the variety of areas, and I liked the builds I did with my character - it felt like you could do well with any sort of build.
Im Tarnished
I hate it, and yet i love it !
A great game but awful PC port. Play it on console.
but hole
weird and hard
Honestly, what can I say that isn't already known? This game is extremely fun, strategic, rewarding yet punishes you for one mistake. Overall, just a solid game that is a must have.
It's Guud...
the  game is amazing, im still getting random freezes, no one seems to find a real solution, it tried it all  besides that the game is great
Great game, took me hundreds of hours to get all the achievements, I think I have now explored the entire map, but the greatest part of this game is the fact that there is always more to discover, I think I finally have done all of it, but it keeps surprising me, well done.
Astonishing!
Very hard, but awesome game, 10/10
No they should not add an easy mode
Excellent !
Funny elden game
Based game, good game. GOTY. Pls get worth full price.
This game is beautiful. The lore is vast and in depth. I simply play this game to wander and explore. I play this game to relax funnily enough. This game is so well done. I wish I could work with a team like this.
Actual challenge 
 it's won game of the year dip-shits
OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH ELDEN RING
I liked the game, take ur time and find builds that makes the game fun for you! And dont forget about the Drip! half the game is getting the right armor set to look at during a cutscene.
yes
At first feels like a good old souls game, then you get the horse which feels VERY weird but still acceptable as a progression from dark souls 3, but then for some reason they require random items to progress and make these items unobtainable if you dont lookup a guide at which point this game completely takes a nose dive.  It essentially is many tiny little dark souls tunnels on a gigantic map without any kind of coherence or connection between them. Its as if they just took all the crap levels they had left over from the previous dark souls games and smushed them together into one game using the "open world" excuse to not have to build any kind of atmosphere or continuity between the levels.  Enemies repeat constantly. You get to see the same copy paste enemies all over the map which would work if this was dark souls tunnels but not with these large "open world" levels.  It feels like a cheap korean mmorpg open world with dark souls "dungeons" which you go into and get absolutely nothing at the end of the tunnel because the tunnel does not interconnect with anything else. Theres really no reason to play this game theres no sense of accomplishment and no atmosphere. Its a mediocre dark souls game and a very bad open world game they really completely failed.
Dark Souls 3.5 is a 7.78/10. Game of the year 2024. Would not recommend. Try playing with a friend while in an extremely small room with no windows. Almost as fun as Dark Souls 2.
Try finger But hole
Even though I got fingers but whole for 100 hours, Id still recommend to anyone
Fort,night
not apex legends
started maidenless. killed the boss, got some maidens and a hug. woke up and realized im still maidenless and now im depressed. Good game
Good ghamsee
too hard
uy
I can definitely see why this got game of the year, absolute blast to play with my brother using the seamless coop mod! Looking forward to starting a NG+ journey.  If you like Pain, Punishment, BDSM, CNC, Scat and Whips. Elden Ring is for you. In all seriousness though once I was done eating Dung, I remembered I have a Fiance and Newborn.
sick as fuck
good 
PC port is fine, console is the best way to go here having platted it on ps5. But game is an all timer and should be played in the best way available. A year later and I still think about and return to this regularly. This is the only game released this gen that's actually worth 70 dollars and that's not even its MSRP. 10/10.
Beautiful desolation. This is pretty much the game I wanted to play when I was a kid, with a stunning open world and near perfect combat.
great game
ring
this game is easy (I've slammed my desk multiple times)
Bih li preporučila igru drugima? I da i ne.  Dobri aspekti su: izgradnja lika, izbor klasa, oružja, način borbe, postupno istraživanje svijeta, elementi iznenađenja, sistem otvorenog svijeta. Grafika je također lijepa, makar bi mogla biti bolja glede teksture. Loš aspekt igre je priča, i to ne zbog konfuznog načina na koji je prezentirana, nego zbog njene kompletne premise. Realno, 90 posto igrača ove igre priču zanemaruje, a i oni tvrdokorni fanovi, koji su igru odigrali više puta; nagađaju o radnji. Po mom skromnom mišljenju priča je loše napisana, i u svojoj biti neka vrsta uvrnute mitologije; tj. hrpa besmislica, bez jasne moralne pouke i ideje. A mislim da to puno govori o onima koji su je osmislili....
Game gud.
It's ok
Challenging good game
Reject society, become Elden Lord.  If you want to escape into a large convincing world full of mysteries and exploration while having an incredibly solid combat system to rely on, not much else can top this.
I got 77 hours of gameplay in 6 days.
Very good
goddrick kinda bad ngl
Elden Bling.
ggood game
yup
Elden Ring to me was a experience like no other. The challenges were great, the suspense and tensions were high, and the characters completely memorable. Nothing is more thrilling and/or relieving than finally killing that boss that took between ten to a hundred attempts to subjugate. Sometimes I cheer at my victory over my opponent, and sometimes I solemnly stare in the spot my opponent turned to dust, realizing I just put down a poor innocent creature that became a monster out of circumstance. Its not a game for the feint of heart, but if you are up for the challenge, Elden Ring is entirely worth it.
Really wish that From Software would put out an fps cap removal update so we can enjoy this masterpiece at 144 fps but other than that absolutely love it!
i've never felt so relaxed while playing a videogame, 10/10
Fun and hard
                                                                                      7/10   This game is amazing and disappointing at the same time, I feel like a lot of these problems is the symptom of being a open world game.   The dungeon design is incredibly frustrating with the way forward being chosen at random it seems, I think this was done to encourage exploration but it just leads to multiple times you run loops around a dungeon while getting very confused.   The bosses are doable at lower levels but incredibly tedious to fight since they take ages to kill. This is the result of them being given a very generous amount of health and one mistake can lead to you getting one shotted. But also this works in the other way where bosses you missed feel way too easy and die in seconds.  Despite all the mistakes, and trust me this game has mistakes, I love it! But it sure has areas to improve in.   
A great and terrible game. It carries all of the baggage of its predecessors, both good and bad, which reminds me of Dark Souls 2 and how it carried all of the baggage of demon's souls and dark souls 1 on its back which left people mixed on it overall.
good
Married a blue Witch doll with 4 arms 10/10

okay game i guess
Ranni can crush my balls
Very Nice game.
Probably better than Fortnite
looks good and has good atmosphere but the combat is so fuck awful it ruins it i'm really trying to like this but i've had such a shit time in it and the only positives is that everything looks cool pretty much all enemies have weird looking attacks to throw you off every single attack they do and have completely different rules to how you work which just makes combat feel like a mess and pretty unsatisfying even when i beat a boss i found hard i just felt annoyed afterwards because the fight just felt like a gimmick fight rather than anything i did was actually skillful or anything like that i'll keep playing but i won't recommend it as it has been a pretty bad experience for the first 20 or so hours for me
Easily one of the best games I've played
OH HELL YES
10/10
Tbh this is like every dark soul game and is only enjoyable if you like grindy games that make u rage quit. If you are a val player, this ones for u.
boring frfr
This game is addictively good
Metin 5 Ro pe dificultate Hard. Lasand toate criticile deoparte, am jucat jocul mai mult din cauza provocarii si a senzatiei de implinire primita dupa ce bati un boss nepregatit. Dar nu este pentru toata lumea. Daca ti au placut RPG urile clasice cum ar fi Witcher 3 si altele, o sa iubesti acest jos.
try finger but hole
praise the Elden Ring!!! also try jump attack
praise the Elden Ring and then try pickle

This game absolutely is massive, with an absolutely colossal map and another huge map underneath, there's tons of stuff to do. There are piles of awesome spells and super fun upgradeable weapons, crazy bosses and wicked powers. There's a lot of flexibility to experiment with different builds because you can re-spec like 9 times per playthrough if you want to change up your playstyle.   It seems to have a really nice community, in game and online that enjoys helping each other out and sometimes invading others to role play the bad guy and try to stop the hero! Awesome fun!   The game is beautiful and hopeful but also filled with despair, from a lore standpoint. This game is definitely challenging but there are many resources online to help the player though tough parts or community members or NPC spirits that can be summoned to assist in clearing hard bosses or areas.  The cut scenes and some of the areas you find in this game are so badass and gnarly. Very metal, which i love personally.  Now for the bad because honesty is key, there are times that you have to jump from object to object and its easy to die doing that. These parts of the game aren't generally necessary to go to thankfully, but can have really good rewards at the end, so there's incentive.    The game punishes mistakes and that can be frustrating.     
This is single-handedly the greatest game I've ever played. I love every piece of it, even when I'm dying over and over, I've never raged and I've never thought about giving up. This game simply fulfills every need for a game, Character Customization, Adventure, Story, Lore, EPICNESS, and in-depth playing fields. Above all else, I could play this game until the end of time. If you have 60$, I promise you're getting the deal of a lifetime.
not as good as ds3 but decent enough
makes me horny
Lot of hype for this game. Must not be my cup of tea. Game is very repetitive such is most games. Visually a great game but as far as game play is concerned, just not impressed. I was bored after 6 hours of total game play.
shoot funny laser at boss. ez W's
One of my best game so far
good game.
hard
A great game that allows for every kind of play style, amazing soundtrack, and beautiful world.
Fun and frustrating
worth it
Is a good game !
Git gud
It deserves all the hype it had, has, and will have, as well as every accolade it has received or will receive. It raises the bar on what a AAA release should be; hundreds of hours of content without a single replay, no degenerate business practices, just good game that combines the classic Souls formula with exploration and rewarding your curiosity akin to Breath of the Wild.
cool game
Try Finger, But Whole
addicting
10/10 no more is just the perfect
jugardo, totalmente recomendado
Das Ausmaß dieses Versagens gerade jetzt ist so unbeschreiblich groß, dass der Name Eldenring noch in hundert Jahren als Schimpfwort für Ketzer verwendet werdet wird. Selbst wenn die gesamte Menschheit ihre kollektive Intelligenz zusammennehmen würde, gäbe es keine denkbare Möglichkeit, einen Weg zu finden, um diese game besser zu machen
baller ah game
U can die endlessly and still want to play.
Never played a souls game before and now i like getting punched in bed.
Great game. Just don't quit after getting killed by Tree Sentinel in the beginning of the game xD.
Cant stop... Wont stop... I stayed away from the hardcore games due to my frustration levels not being able to handle it. But once your in.. Jesus wow what a game. Great job all around been gaming for over 35 years and this has been one of my most pleasant experiences ever.
Great game, tons of replay-ability
Very great game. The one thing i love more then the game play is the filing of killing a boss its great :]
help am addict
This is my first FromSoftware game, but not my last.  The world is expansive, horizontally and vertically.  Very few times is there a load screen, as almost all of the world is one giant map.  Given the size, it is quite impressive.    The plot...   well, you will need to be a sleuth, online guide reader, or completionist to really get what is going on.  I really just got the main plot, but even that was over 90 hours.  I bought it slightly on sale, which is great, but any dark souls fans will get their monies' worth out of it.  EPic grand open  world that is dark forboding and creepy.  Not for everyone, but as of this writing over 20 million copies, so maybe it is for everyone.  YOU WILL DIE ALOT  8/10
getting onehsot is fun
Sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit. 10/10
One of my favorite games.  beware of dog.
everything is great EXCEPT the controls, they SUCK! and i played on a PS controller, keyboards arent better. but its a nice game, i will begin my second play through after a month or two.
rich open world  good bosses

Fucking masterpiece
Hard do find words for this one. From Software managed to pour their Dark Souls-formula into a monstrous open-world adventure. Monstrous because always motivationg, engaging, interesting, while taking players seriously. It also has an enormous tasteful artstyle. There are enough little helps to support new players to soulslike.   A game for the ages, I seriously can`t think how From Software will top this achievement of a game. 
Most enjoyable game I've ever played
try fingers, but hole?
Despite a number of glaring flaws, Elden Ring is easily one of the best and most memorable games I have ever played.

This is epic.
Elden Ring is an action role playing RPG game/PP crusher simulator created by FromSoftware where you explore the open world of the Lands Between and fight hard bosses in between completing quests and trying not to die. I fell in love with the Soulsborne series when I first started playing Bloodborne on the PS4, after which I went out on a whim and bought myself Demon's Souls for PS3 as well as Dark Souls 1-3. I heard about this game a while ago, got hyped and pre-ordered as soon as I could before waiting a year to start the game. Having platinumed the game on PS5 and hoping to start on Steam someday in the future, here are my thoughts:  The Story is one of those things that you just have to kind of explore and figure out by piecing together pieces of dialogue, item descriptions as well as environmental cues. I can't even tell you much of anything about it, but what I can say is like all FromSoft Souls titles, I love it. It keeps the goal simple: You're a Tarnished (an individual who was banned by the former queen from the Lands Between) who is going for the spot of Elden Lord and to do so has to fight through several different demigods in order to do so. You'll run into several characters via out in the world or the Hubworld, Roundtable Hold, who could do anything from basically nothing to giving you entire new endings. That's all I have to say for the plot:  The Gameplay is basically almost the same as the other games in the Souls Series. You go from area to area to loot objects, fight bosses, complete particular quest lines for certain rewards, invade/fight enemy invaders except one caveat: It’s open world. And I mean it’s OPEN world. The other games were a lot more simplified as well as complex: they were a bit open in terms of pathways, shortcuts etc but they also had a straight way from point A to point B as well. In this game, everything is basically tenfold in terms of it’s game play design from how you get to certain areas to how to fight certain bosses. One example: [Spoiler] In order to get to Leyendell there’s a couple different ways you can get to that region. One is you could ride up the Grand Lift of Dectus, where you need two halves of a medallion in which you can get each at Forth Haight and Fort Faroth. Another way you could do it is by going underneath a church near the Lift, going through a village and climbing up a mountain before killing the Magma Wyrm and getting up that way. ANOTHER way is to get killed/abducted at the bottom of the waterwheel in Raya Lucaria where you wake up in an area at Volcano Manor and fight your way out of the caves.[/Spoiler] Stuff like this is mindblowing and is amazing how much attention to detail and scope it took to truly create such a thing. And keep in mind this is only one example, I can’t list everything because truthfully, like this game, there’s so much stuff TO list that I’d be making a f u c king video essay on it. But also in essence I do think that can be to this game’s detriment as well: It’s so huge that it’s kind of overwhelming with its scale, and with that it can lose some of it’s uniqueness when you see multiple of the same bosses repeated over and over again with different skins. I also found the combat to be hard definitely, challenging is a yes, but I’m not sure if it’s just because I suck but I felt that now in this game it’s definitely more geared towards having summon spirits for boss combat? I’ve always been someone who liked to coop anyways so I’ve been cool with it but it can be kind of frustrating at times with certain bosses. I guess to finish this off just be aware that this game is difficult yes, but the community is great. Sure, are there a s sholes who will just tell you to “Get Gud'' and make believe they aren’t a bunch of basement dwelling pee larpers? Yes. But the amount of people who will go out of their way to help you for no reason other than why not is amazing. Just know in order to summon people: Get the Furlcalling Finger Remedy. They can be found as loot, crafted via Erdleaf Flowers, bought from certain merchants, etc. Also for certain places to be able to summon other players you have to activate summoning pools so keep a lookout for small statues.  Sound Design/Art/Graphics; all of this is great and I’m not even sure I could expand upon it other than I don’t feel that the Soundtrack is as memorable as the other souls games? Either way it didn’t matter to me as it fit in the background and made everything memorable as I played even though when I got out of it I didn’t remember much. Still it looks great, the art design is amazing and graphics are good too.  I can’t do justice to this game in a single Steam review, but if you’re new to the series or you wanna try it out just know this: Play fresh, wing it a bit and have fun, try not to get overwhelmed and experience EVERYTHING because it’s impossible (though it is possible to get all the trophies in one playthrough if that’s your thing). Research the game a bit, see what builds you want to go for (though your starting class does kind of gear you in certain ways so I’d say research BEFORE you start the game unless you just kinda want to wing it), farm a bit and upgrade your stats. But please god take breaks and take it at your own pace; because you will die and die and die some more and then die again; it can be a frustrating and strange loop but when it clicks with you it clicks with you. And if it doesn’t? That’s ok too and there’s no shame in it. Elden Ring is the culmination of all the things that FromSoft has done with the other Souls games and expanded upon it with great effect (and sometimes mixed results in certain things), but to me it certainly deserves the Game of the Year title.
game is ez, give it a try : )
very nice
İ cant play with my ps5 dualsense why dont you ada a ps4/5 ui for this game?
This game is GOD

Game good!
I found the elden ring
First Souls Game I have ever played. only just begun my journey so i find myself lost trying to find the words to describe how beautiful and immersive this game truly is! GOTY for a reason beyond a shadow of a doubt!
one of the games of all time
a world full of awe and excitement
老头环天下第一！！！
Great!
This game has beautiful scenery and the fights are tough but rewarding. I also enjoy all of the hidden items I can explore for. I highly recommend.
Beautiful. Perfect. Immaculate.
its so fucking good
One of the best games out there, If you are thinking of buying it, do it, it's worth your time, there is a lot of gameplay and you will never get bored.   
This game is incredible. Im on my third play through and its still fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who want to try a FromSoft game.
loved all the  goblin sex but the actually game play is ripped straight from minecraft and the graphics from uno this is done without remorse, however the story was great its a shame they had to get budget tolkien to write it tho. To sum up play this game if you find smurfs attractive.
Happy 1 Year Anniversary to this flawed masterpiece!
Elden Ring really feels like a culmination of Fromsoft. It is not perfect. You've probably already heard the major criticisms about late game areas and repeat bosses. However this, and Dark Souls II, were the only games that made me feel like the build variety was begging me to play consecutive playthroughs. Completed thrice back to back, and I've still not touched magic/intelligence builds. The first playthrough was magical. 151hrs of deep exploration. The most accessible and QoL-centric game in the series to date <3

Skill issue
Very good game
Deserved GOTY   10/10 Game.
It's nice to see a game with a fun and difficult combat system, loot and gear that actually changes the way you approach each encounter and not the same weapon, again and again but with different stats. And most of all, a fresh way of presenting the it's opent and vast world.  The lands between await the. Become a tarnished yourself. Buy this game!
The perfect game for those who like to spend their evenings getting repeatedly pummeled into submission. If you're into BDSM, then this game will have you moaning.  From the very beginning, Elden Ring will whip you into shape, throwing you into a world full of sadistiic enemies and punishing gameplay. Every corner you turn is like a new level of torture, a new level of submission to your gaming overlords.  But don't worry because the pain is worth it. There's nothing more satisfying than finally defeating that boss that's been spanking you for hours. And when you do, you'll feel likea real badass!  Elden Ring is also full of surprises, just like a good dominatrix. You never know what's coming next, and every new challenge is like a new way to be punished.  The graphics are gorgeous, and the soundtrack will have you begging for more. But let's be honest, you're not here for the aesthetics. You're here to be put in your place, to be dominated by a game that knows no mercy.  It's no wonder that Elden Ring has been hailed as the game of the year. It's a true work of sadomasochistic art. The unforgiving difficulty, the punishing combat, the unpredictable challenges - it all comes together in a way that's truly amazing.  Sure, you'll rage and scream and maybe even throw your controller across the room a few times. But in the end, you'll be left with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that few other games can provide.  So if you're a true glutton for punishment, Elden Ring is the game for you. It's totally worth a buy, and it might just leave you begging for more.

yes
I have 3 fingers, I'm missing 7 from a birth defect. I beat this game without summons (except for a certain duo boss LOL) and without op weapons. If I can beat this game on "hard mode" the first time then any of you can beat it, some without the summons and other mechanics to make it easier, and some with. Never let anyone criticize the way you play the game, the important thing is that you actually play it, because it's something everyone should experience. If you feel you're worried that it'll be too hard, don't be. Just play it in such a way that it becomes easier.   I'm giving this game a 8.5/10. It would be a 10/10 if it weren't for the incredibly strange boss design in a lot of cases, i.e extremely long combos with a tiny window to counterattack, camera issues aplenty due to size of bosses, insane tracking across arena, and super delayed, awkward attacks. Also there are way too many reused catacombs and bosses in general The fact that I'm giving this game a 9/10 even with such big issues tells you everything you need to know.
Yes very fun but very hard game. Tip never use Blasphemous Blade, Moonveil or Rivers of blood if you don want to be a pussy.
I'm someone who mostly only plays online game and have never been much of a single player gamer. that said elden ring is by far the best single player experience I've ever had and have played though it multiple times. in my eyes this is a true master peace.
WWWWWWWWWWWWW
Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.
Eighty-ish hours and one trophy later, five takeaways from The Lands Between™:  * The game's hardware requirements are correct: if you want to play Elden Ring at a consistent 1080p60, your CPU needs at least 6 cores and 12 threads. Never mind the main storyline, the true final boss is realizing that lowering the display resolution and graphics quality to 720p/Low won't get you a stable 60fps on an otherwise-serviceable quad-core CPU. If you don't have a hexacore CPU, see if your graphics software can lock the frame rate to 30; I found a steady 30fps to be a better visual experience than a stuttery ~45fps. * After a single, pseudo-100% clear spanning several weeks, speedrunning this twice for the other ending achievements was a breath of fresh air.  * Vigor and armor can prevent being one-shot in combat, but nothing can prevent getting one-shot by fall damage. This rule applies to your enemies, too. * In a world where 'RTFM' is sage advice, if a game isn't going to explicitly tell you what's going on, never be ashamed to do your own research. It's always easier to search for information out-of-game than to search for your lost runes in-game. * Whoever made the final call on the HUD only displaying piecewise elements that were recently used without flickering or cluttering up the screen deserves high praise. Conversely, whoever made the final call on putting a boss directly in a pile of scarlet rot *more than once* needs to update their resume. * Bonus 6th takeaway: Malenia's a bully, but Waterfowl Dance is the only truly threatening aspect of her kit. Try complaining less and getting better at the game. Or you can equip Blasphemous Blade/Magma Wyrm Scalesword and press L2 after dodging, that works too.
Jar Bairn my boi
margit the fell omen is an ugly little prick and i hope he/him jumps off of the top of stormveil castle
Just straight up not good at all. I have nothing positive to say about this game. I know it's FoRmSoFt but it's just... there are better games.
This game made me kiss men and want to be stood on by a 4-armed Welsh Woman.  10/10
I think I have never written a review, but for this game I have to. That's how good it is. :)
Item and mob randomiser mods are for confirmed gods. only. no flask shards and no seeds, first boss was mohg. 10/10 game wouldnt ever stop playing for the litreral rest of my life.
Elden Ring strikes a perfect balance between challenging and rewarding - a must play for everyone!
Good ass Game
I enjoyed
Fun game that can be played for a long time :)
Worth the Game of the Year Award !

Elden Ring is an incredible game that combines the best of both worlds: the immersive storytelling of FromSoftware and the open-world exploration of George R. R. Martin. The game's world is breathtakingly beautiful, filled with stunning vistas and intricate details that make it feel truly alive. The combat system is fluid and intuitive, allowing players to engage in thrilling battles against a variety of challenging enemies. The game's story is captivating, with a rich lore that draws players in and keeps them hooked until the very end. Overall, Elden Ring is a must-play for anyone who loves action RPGs, open-world games, or just great storytelling.
GOTY for a reason!!!
Try finger, but hole
Unga bunga
Best Game made in the last ten years
kool game in general
worst game i've ever played. 10/10
its the greatest game ever made
What to say that's not already been said about sliced bread?
Ignore the hype, ignore you're friends, don't bother playing this game. REQUIRES AT LEAST 10 hours of tutorial videos on builds, basic game mechanics, and side quests that exist in the game before actually playing. The game does not teach you anything about how to play it, you need to rely on outside help in order to progress. This includes basic things like how to navigate the menu, how to create a strong character, which weapons to use, etc. The difficulty curve is set up so that you NEED to learn these things early on, else you will not progress in the game.  To start off, here is the entire plot to the game: you want to be elden lord, maybe. That's it. Some characters are more or less keen on that, but it's not really clear. Most of the lore and "story" of the game can be found in item descriptions, and its the most ineffectual way to tell a story that I have ever encountered. Side missions have zero logic to them, basically you need to talk to every NPC in the game in order to progress a mission without referencing a guide or tutorial. Most missions have a point where you grab some item like "the sacred toenail of Ira the dancer" and for some reason you are supposed to know that "Ephesius" needs that to make it to Narnia or some nonsense like that. Many of these side missions are necessary to beat the game at a reasonable difficulty level, else you will be under leveled or poorly equipped to face required bosses.  Honestly I can't talk about this game without referencing the menu, it is the most poorly organized, laziest feature to any video game I have ever played. This studio has had an entire decade to hone the menuing system in their RPG game, and the best thing they can come up with is a literal grab bag of items organized like a pile of clothes on a teenagers dorm room floor. I cannot tell you how many times I grabbed an item only to never use it in my play-through simply because I lost it in the menu. There is a lantern in this game, and I have to play Where's Waldo every single time I try to equip it simply because I picked something up on the ground in an open world RPG game, and it reshuffled my items.  Gameplay wise, its a souls game. That is to say, its a rhythm game that tries to cheese you every step of the way. In some ways, I find this rewarding, especially when facing groups of enemies in the games various dungeons. Assuming you have min/maxed your character to make the fight doable of course. Most of these encounters are well set up to challenge you to figure out a strategy to beat them consistently, given limited space and resources. Unfortunately, this is an open world game, and the majority of encounters occur in the open world. In these cases, it is easy to bypass encounters by going around them, or fighting them one on one. To make up for that, the game designers added lots of harder enemies that are required fights for one reason or another. All of these fights devolve into "big guy with sword in field" or "big guy with axe in field", and have basically the same move sets. The best way to deal with them is to grind levels until you can easily combo or one shot them, otherwise you're in for repetitive, uninspired fights. A majority of enemies are direct copy pastes of one another, and it's a shame.  It's a shame because the art might be the best I have seen in a video game. There are many biomes/areas to explore, and each their own unique artistic style to them. You can easily tell which area you are in just by the art style of the world around you. I visited every single area in this game simply because I wanted to explore the environment that the artists created, and I put up with all of repetitive gameplay and the obnoxious bosses to do it.  The bosses in this game suffer the same issue as the enemies. At least half are re-used throughout the game, the worst example being used at least 6 times. Many of them share similar move-sets as well, making the artistically unique bosses seem like copies of earlier ones. Put simply, fighting them is a chore. The bigger, "demigod" bosses are more unique, at least early in the game. But more often than not, they can only be defeated by a "normal" player by cheesing them. Multiple times in this game I have been impressed by a boss design, only to realize the best way to defeat them is an unsatisfying cheese that the game gives you as an apology for making their boss unbeatable at the level you are supposed to face them. Towards the end of the game, it becomes a boss rush, and there are no more cheese strategies available. In order to beat these, you need to enter into an hours long gameplay loop of getting one shot to each combo they throw out so you can learn the precise moment you need to dodge in order to avoid their attacks. If you grind hard enough, you can eventually see the ending to a game with zero story.  I played this game because a friend recommended it. They said they enjoyed it, and they hoped I did too, and then apologized for telling me I should play it. Many people on here have the same story, and many of their friends say they enjoyed the game as well. The only explanation I can come up with is that this game is Type 2 fun. When you are in the moment, playing the game, its terrible. Once you are done, and you've completed it, the feeling of accomplishment you get overshadows those moments of frustration, the monotony of grinding, and the times you left the game defeated. You commiserate with your friends, and it becomes a shared experience that you can connect with. Eventually you forget the negative feelings you had while playing the game, and the memories that persist are those of the adventure you embarked on, and the feeling of growth that came out of it.  But when I play this game, I can't help but wonder what I actually am supposed to get out of it. I pressed dodge the exact millisecond I needed to five times in a row, and won a boss encounter because of it. Was that worth it? Is practicing this one button press for an hour straight really what I'm doing with my time? More than anything, thing game makes me question why I spend time playing it instead of doing something else.  The first encounter in Elden Ring is with a hulking mass of thrashing bodies, congealed in a spider like blob of legs and arms. If it is your first playthrough, it easily dispatches you with a few swipes of its relatively tiny sword, shrugging off any damage you attempt to inflict. Veteran players, expecting the monster, can beat it with well timed dodges and strikes, though it is no easy feat. The reward for doing so is a short walk to a nearby pathway, where the ground gives out, killing you instantly. The same can be said for the game as a whole. No matter what you do, the end result is the same, you get nothing for your time, your energy, your frustration. In the end, it is a futile waste of effort.  Go read a book instead.
its elden ring what can i say every buddy knows its a 10/10 game lol bozo
Its p good
good game
.
Just i Little bit 
elden ring therfore elden ring ahead
sb
very nice from soft game
god
Great game  but i suck ass at it  :(
epik game for epik gamers
im trash at the game fr fr
I'm sure you've heard of all the great things people say about this game. Beautiful art style, intriguing lore/story, insane level design, amazing combat etc.. So I'll just say this.. this is the best game I've ever played
Elden Ring is unique even in the soul-like genre. Unlike previous titles that rewarded u for pushing on challenging boss after boss, Elden Ring rewards u for exploration. Instead of finding amazing weapons from main game bosses, exploring dungeons or fighting open-world bosses seems to be the most rewarding and gifts you with some amazing weapons. Weapons like rivers of blood or moonveil are not obtained following some flashy quest or beating some god-ass boss, instead, u find them in the world organically.  Every boss that u may find difficult has a weapon that could blow it to kingdom come and can be found with a little exploring. Reading descriptions helps as well, for e.g a certain boss who inflicts a blood spell that eats 3 flasks can be countered with an item that u just find. The spirit system is also a great mechanic for all of the journalists out there u can finally enjoy these games and for the rest of u git good. 11/10
I want to die.
I like seeing the "YOU DIED" like 20 times a day
It's been two and a half months now since I 100%'ed this game. I haven't had the urge to go back to it a single time since. I didn't hate the time I spent with it, but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it either. I had never played a FromSoftware game before – whenever I saw someone play one of their Souls-games I thought "Wow that looks absolutely horrible and about as fun as going to the dentist." And I didn't necessarily mean the difficulty (and more specifically the way in which they are "difficult"), but also the aesthetics and how the movement and physics looked like.  But, given the absolutely insane hype levels for Elden Ring I decided to finally give one of them a shot. Unfortunately my intuition was correct: The movement does feel like you're controlling a semi truck on molasses. It just does not *feel* fun to do anything in this game, be it running around or fighting. I'm not talking about the way heavy vs. light loadouts feel, the very foundations of movement and physics in this game just don't appeal to me. Of course as a Souls-beginner it also took some getting used to, but that happened fairly quickly. I didn't have any trouble with it, but it's not something that would draw me to the game – which is problematic, considering that movement makes up most of the gameplay.  The other part, the aesthetics, also mostly didn't click for me just as I expected. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that the art direction in this game is very well done. (I do think that it's a tad bit overhyped, though – the game looks good, but it doesn't look great.) But with very few exceptions it is all just pain and despair, mud and dirt, darkness and gloom. There's not enough contrast between areas that are some variation of "big end of the world mood" and more light-hearted areas. I understand that this makes sense from a story perspective, but it's just not something I enjoy very much. Why would I want to spend 100+ hours in this utterly depressing hellscape, with no respite to make it all worth it?  Speaking of story… well. It certainly has some GRRM aspects to it, but not so much the good ones that gave us amazing stories well over a decade ago, but the ones that just drip feed the idea of something bigger and better still to come, pinky promise, anytime now! If you're lucky enough to even stumble upon some story, it's usually confusing and feels irrelevant/disconnected. I hate modern Ubisoft open world games as much as anyone else, but Elden Ring absolutely does not even come close to do this right in the way that Breath of the Wild did. The fact that most players will go to a Wiki to be able to figure out how to finish (or even find and begin…) quest lines is a scathing indictment of how badly the game fails at telling its stories.  The "async coop" did not click with me either. The ghosts of other players pretty much never revealed anything of interest to me. At best they could be ignored, at worst they were a distraction. Far worse are the hints, which gives a pretty good insight into the headspace of the fan base of this game. "try finger but hole" is their idea of peak comedy, and everyone falls over themselves making this same joke for the billionth time. More serious ones like "enemy/treasure ahead" are worthless as well, because you can never know if it is a troll or not. So you do check any nooks and crannies anyway – and there's nothing wrong with a game wanting you to do so, but what's the point of these hints then.  Finally, the difficulty. Yeah, it's pretty hard if you don't farm XP and overlevel yourself. The game does an okay job of being a difficult game. Considering that it's a fairly complex 3D open world game, you can't expect great loading times after you die, but the gameplay also isn't designed for dying as often and freely as for example something like Celeste – which lets you continue playing after death within milliseconds. There's a couple of spots that are just infuriating, though, mostly to do with elevators. Site of grace next to the elevator, you ride it up and there's an area where you most likely will die a whole bunch of times before getting through. Every damn time after dying and respawning at the site of grace you not only have to ride back up – you first have to call the elevator back down because it is still above from your earlier ride. Of course that is logical and "correct", but that doesn't make it any less annoying. Resetting an elevator next to a site of grace to be on your level upon respawning would have been such an obvious QoL improvement, but Elden Ring does not give you any of those. And hardcore fans will defend that as realism, or a counter to the oh so horrible hand-holding that games do these days. But that's bs. Little annoyances like that don't make a game harder or "more real", they just make it more annoying.  It's these kinds of things that make me think that Elden Ring was rushed out in the end, and I'm genuinely baffled by the praise it gets for supposedly being "one of the good ones" when compared to other AAA games and their need for day one patches. I didn't _mind_ the stuttering issues the game still has on PC, but they haven't even been fixed. I had _a ton_ of bugs and glitches and some crashes even. Nothing too bad or unexpected for a game of this scale, but Elden Ring is not some magic outlier here that does things much better or differently than other good AAA games, of which there is still plenty.  So, do I recommend this game? No, I personally do not. If your taste in games is like mine, you won't enjoy it very much. I don't regret my time with it, because now I know definitively that Souls-games just aren't for me. But that thumbs-down is not meant to say that it's a bad game, despite all my criticisms above. A lot of them are very subjective, and the ones that I'd say are a bit more objective aren't dragging the game down too much. I can absolutely understand why people love this game, but unfortunately I didn't.
amazing wow
I hated Dark Souls. I was never a fan of that stupid gameplay where you chip away for hours while rolling incessantly.  Nevertheless I gave Elden Ring a go and oh BOY is this game fun. I've played 60h in the last two weeks and I am far from done. They did everything right. First game in a long time I payed full price for and did not regret one bit.  
first souls game. loved it and even beat it, albeit by gaining high levels.

Yes YES YESSSSS Get it. Beautiful game, Fun fights, Big World. Pretty cool characters. HOT ARMOR I mean cool looking armor and other things like weapons and crafting. While the game is hard its totally possible to just play it like an open world kinda with the dark souls stuff. Great game. Went insane, started laughing, had so much fun from the adrenaline of the fights 10/10 would get beaten up and beat up everything in the game that isn't Online for me :D
Epic and beautiful game
bagus
amazing game
As I have fully beaten Elden Ring and gained all the achievements, I think I am more than qualified to say:  Elden Ring is certainly by far the game of all time.  In a world filled with interactive movies, glorified quasi-gambling services, online-only dystopia, and games saturating the market with the same tales, again and again... Elden Ring offers the most important aspect of any video game: Actually gettin to flippin play it. (And LOTS of it.) The others have their reasons (I'm not getting into it), but it is always good to return to the roots of video games by focusing heavily on gameplay. You wanna play a video game? You wanna play LOTS of gamin'? Then get this game. Does it have flaws? Absolutely; quite a few. But the game is still well worth it, I think. Most of them are from a vet's perspective, so I can't say much. If you are new to the Fromsoft games, though, you should be much less irked by these things, assuming you even see any to begin with. I look forward to them polishing up and making Elden Ring a much more complete experience, and I'll see you all on the battlefields of Elden Ring 7: Quest 4 The Onion Ring. May The Golden Order shine through you all. Good luck.
hmm. i think good game.
good game
This is an incredible, open world game with expansive immersion. Highly recommended
I've been an avid gamer for a long time, and have played all sorts of games in many different genres. This however was my first time playing a game from From Soft and I admit it was daunting, but I like a challenge! If this is your first Souls game like it was mine Buckle up Buttercup! Your in for a fun ride!!!
TOP
veery good american says its good aswell
Godlike ha ho wee ha ha good ha fafa good good
While I did give a yes vote as a recommendation, it comes with a few warnings. This game is NOT made for the PC, it is/was made strictly as a lesser game build for the consoles and it shows. The graphics are not as great as they should be on a PC title. In the first 25 hours the graphical tricks used are obvious and show through the facade of standard console tricks used to help consoles with their performance issues.  Another warning is the beyond nonsensical game interface, it was made strictly for a game pad, and it shows. While it is up to the developers to provide proper access and proper ports to the PC, the effort was minimal to the point the PC port of this game is a meme by itself in regards to the keyboard layout and interface choices and key binds.  While a huge number of people chime away with "This is a souls title" to wave away the criticism in regards to the poor PC keyboard layout and control options. I do not let these developers off the hook. The keyboard layout and UI suck in a big way. If you do not have a game pad, or do not like to use one, you will be at a disadvantage as there is no assigning any interface controls in a common sense layout. It took me quite a while to get used to the console style approach to minimalist, multi-function buttons in a rotary layout instead of the standard assign whatever action on whatever keystroke freedom I am used to.  Another part of the game I do not like is the forced pvp aspect with invasions or the multitude of notes that can be left. The notes clutter the areas, have questionable messages and do nothing for immersion. The invasions, even in a password protected setting is a very stupid choice on the part of the developers. it adds nothing to the game experience and actually degrades the games lore and entertainment values.  These things are simply immature carrots for the drop in and drop out crowd and do nothing for the game itself except to let the worst in people ruin an otherwise good game experience. If you want to experience the game without these poorly executed interruptions, play offline, trust me on this.  If you are willing to re-learn a bunch of control movements and a very poor UI interface, the game does have a large world and a great challenge with tons of secrets. Though I feel a big part of that challenge is wading through the developers lazy design choices and not the story itself. Elden ring is not the first souls games and is a foray into the bigger RPG market in which it is a mild success. Recently Elden Ring began touting it's sales figures and not giving info on returns so i contacted them. I was told they do not give out that info. I laughed at that reply.
its ight
Stunning graphics and solid combat. However the game stops giving you any direction or anything. Easy to find yourself at level 1 triggering an endgame boss fight with no idea where you need to head. 0/10
Made me enjoy dark souls and allowed myself to appreciate harder content
Vast, just vast, difficult but playable. This is pure awe!
Yeah its pretty good.
Thoughtful design and deep lore. Combat system with tons of options to get creative with tools that you discover. The open world doesn't feel empty. This game can be punishing and rewarding. If it's too hard, try playing co-op with friends or strangers and enjoy the exciting dungeons leading to epic boss fights.
Faith
Good
good soup
It’s bad 
its a game
This is the game to play if you have always wanted to play a Souls like but thought they were too punishing. Elden Ring is still difficult. The difference is that Elden Ring is open world. Boss kicking your butt? Go somewhere else and come back later. You don't have to beat your head against a wall to "git gud". The sense of exploration and the numerous ways you can build your character is addicting. I did have some stuttering issues on a 3070 but I suspect it will be patched out at some point.
Good game to play if you want to suffer
one of the games of all time
Pretty good 
Best game of all time
super hard
this game makes you feel like u can parry bullets irl
amboutokum
I'm not very good at this game but still enjoy it.  
This game rocks.
its good
Its a great game with engaging combat, difficult enemys, and an interesting and expansive world to explore whats not to like?
HARD. FUN. 3 BROKEN CONTROLLERS
진짜로 최고의 게임이라고 생각합니다! 오픈월드와 소울류를 동시에 즐길 수도 있고, 입문하기도 좋고, 게임 하는 맛이 너무 좋아요
Never felt so happy and so free to have my soul repeatedly crushed by Miyazaki's work
Brilliant, I'm 10 hours in and have gotten no where and its amazing
great game. Every enemy two hits you late game; love it.
This was my first game from a darksoul like. Beat the game 3 times and I had so much fun. Can't wait for the DLC.
This game is the definition of insanity
died to margit like 400 times then i just got gud. beat 99% of side quests and main story in 75 hours. this game brought back a feeling that i havent had since my early teen years. cant wait for another. in the meantime, ill be grinding out the other endings to this game and playing the rest of the souls games.
After playing for 60 hrs on my xbox and 10 hrs on Steam I can confidently say its my favourite game of all time.
Game breaking crash at Siofira River with no apparent fix.
Elden Ringer
I'm a little late, one year exactly, but the game is still very fun.
Yes but also no
fuck the fire giant
Well What can I say except , just buy it ?   This was my First Soulslike and to my surprise , I didnt break anything (Yet)  Many things to talk about why this game is good. But Time will not permit that
I got to tell you, it was Perfect. Perfect..  
I'm horrible at this game and it was still fun.   elonara's poleblade solos
such an amasing game so fun a little hard at timed would recomend multi player  so fun definetley play worth every penney 
Great game but you might need to sell your kidney to run it. Or someone else's kidney if just not sure how you'd get that from someone else.
yes do
you died
elden ring
Love this game!!!
(::)?
w game
I waited years for this game to arrive. Now one year after it has and after my second play through, I still don't think there is a better game out there. What an amazing achievement. Bravo!!
very hard but is very fun
I'm not maidenless anymore
love it
Pretty fun, not as hard as people make it out to be. (was expecting more of a challenge for my first souls game)
One of the best games ever made.
Love it, who doesn't?
pretty good
Improves on everything that make the Dark Souls series fun. Jumping can dodge attacks which gives more depth to the combat and also makes for fun jump attacks, magic is strong with some more unique spells instead of just bigger magic soul arrow. Only downside is there is only one really big hat, need more big hats.
HARD!!!!!!!!
1 year later, Elden Ring still stands as one of the best games of all time and one of my favorite video games ever made. Everything about this game is incredible and ever since I was a kid I always wanted a game exactly like this. Elden Ring exceeded my expectations and people complaining about the game are just nitpicking to find something bad to say about the game without realizing that this game is a genuine masterpiece in every way possible. While I do have some minor nitpicks myself, they are so minute that it doesn't effect the game overall. Elden Ring was so good that after not writing a review for 6 years I'm doing one for this game. It definitely deserved Game of the Year and will be one of my favorite games ever made.  Elden Ring is a 10/10 Masterpiece
Yes, I do like vanilla
If you like hard games and that challenge you this is the right game for u but the price is very high
The best FromSoftware game absolute Masterpiece.
when i
Best game
"Souls-Like"? This is Miyazaki. This is Konami Bandcai. This is FromSoftware. This is what you expect from this franchise of greatness. This is the next iteration of greatness. This is everything Dark Souls / Demon Souls 3,2,1 was and more. Non-Linear. Go wherever you want. More places to explore. Around every corner is a new event, a new dungeon, new characters. Still the best DS game to play since it came out in 2022. If you like any of those games, you need to play this.
good
It's very difficult but very rewarding when you kill a boss or an enemy that has killed you for so long. Would highly recommend!
Its Ok I guess
Seems to be an Interesting game to get into.  Open world exploration, not really direction given for gameplay however. But, it does make it enjoyable to play.  Would recommend for you to get into.
i think this game is pretty fun when i play it.
Absolutely Stunning!
.
its good but exploring doesnt feel very rewarding
👍
i wanna fuck that doll
gud :) 
over 100 hours in and at the end on xbox. i always love fromsoft games. this one is no different
The Frenzied Flame Has a Good Point.
great 
Hands down, amazing game.
fucki
Get good, grind and explore. Fun times will be had
Great Value, Great Gameplay, and Extremely Challenging!  Never played Dark Soul Games before the first time. Hate Love Relationship
its very good
I like it when i get crushed by the big smooth throbbing balls
oya
omg
Let's say you've been a bad empyrean. Let's say, hypothetically, you've been a naughty empyrean even. Ok, and if you were a naughty empyrean, you would be my dirty little Miquella right? Then hypothetically speaking, you would be my little cocoon-slut. Now, let's say you're also Luminary Mohg's consort.  Now that we have established that you are both a bad empyrean and Mohgussy's consort, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that you deserve an abduction. Am I not correct? A bad empyrean deserves an abduction, and as I am mohgussy, you are my consort, so I am the one who must provide godhood.
someone must extinguish thy flame....
shits lit fr
good gaym
Fun, challenging, beautiful game.
i wanna kms
It's a very challenging game, I like that it does not hold your hand while you play! Graphics are beautiful!
you see that mountain?
Words just cant describe how awesome is this game.. Simply the best single player experience i have ever tried.. This is my 1st From software game. Trully is a masterpiece. The world is masive, and u are free on a real open world, full of incredible challenges and enemies. Fights , weapons and combat system is just epic!!! If u pay atention to npcs its ez to follow quest and lore. What a game and thankfull for it. a true Game of the year!!!
As a guy who kinda sucks at gaming I will say this. This game is fantastic. It gives you so many options so if you aren't able to "get good" by fighting one boss, you can "get good" by exploring other areas and there are practically always other areas to explore. Often times after you go back to the boss you find him a whole lot easier.   This game is able to be gorgeous and grotesque simultaneously and does so really well.  Lastly, this game is rewarding in a way that seems to be exceedingly uncommon in modern gaming. It provides truly challenging areas that take effort to beat without making super spongy enemies (unless you venture into some areas where you are significantly under-leveled) which makes the  game have a high pay off.
Third fav open world rpg
good
My first Souls like game, and at first I dropped this game after about 10 hours into it. A few months later I said fuck it and gave it another go, this time though I wanted to see it through. This game is amazing. once I had finally beatin this game, for the first time, I just sat in awe. I feel so empty now and will try out the dark souls series. Hopefully NG+ will be just as fun but I dont think I'll ever have that same feeling as my first time through this story.
 b
Very Good. Extremely Enticing Game play, And I love The Magma Wrym Boss, And When He Kills Me Every Single Time I Get Him Low. Would Definitely Recommend This Game To My Grandma.
When my computer is not exploding, very good game from a small indie developer.
GOTY
hairline receded at least an inch playing this game. would definitely recommend
A+
This game is a masterpiece but sometimes I want to kms
i beat game 4 hours ez game
[h1] Foul Tarnished [/h1]  [i]muhteşem[/i]  Bu incelemede hem Elden Ring'i yorumlayıp (spoiler olmadan) hem de yapımcı şirket ve tür benzediği için favori oyunlarımdan Sekiro ile karşılaştırmalar yapacağım.  Öncelikle Elden Ring'in devasa bir dünyası var, harita değil dünya. Açık dünya oyunlarının çoğunda olduğu gibi haritası bomboş/tekrarlama değil. Gittiğiniz her noktada işinize yarayacak farklı objeler bulabiliyorsunuz. Renk paleti bana soluk gelmedi, bazı yerler inanılmaz renklerde sonbaharı yaşarken bazı yerler olması gerektiği gibi karanlık.  Sekiro'da bu durum doğal olarak tamamen farklı çünkü lineer koridor mantığı olan bir oyun. [b]Haritada keşif yapma hissini Elden Ring inanılmaz başarılı yapmış.[/b]  [b]Oyunun yönetimi ve hikaye kısmında George R.R. Martin ile Hidetaka Miyazaki var haliyle doyurucu. Türe alışık olmayanlar için hikaye ilk başta bölük gelebilir, saatlerce hikaye namına ne bok yaptıklarını bilmeden etrafta gezebilirler.[/b] Souls oyunlarında oyunun hikayesini öğrenmek için önemli eşyaların açıklamalarına bakmalı, NPC'lerin senle veya diğer NPC'lerle konuşması varsa dinleyip parçaları birleştirmelisin. Girişte ana hikayeden biraz bahsedilse bile hikayeyi tepside sunmayacak. [b]Hikayede negatif olduğunu düşündüğüm şey birden fazla görev ağı bulunan NPC'ler. Bazı karakterlerin görevlerini devam ettirmek için kesinlikle internetten araştırmalısın, o kadar alakasız yerlerde bir şeyler yapman gerekiyor ki araştırmadan bulmak imkansız.[/b] Yapımcı Miyazaki zaten oyunlarının internette bol bol konuşulup hakkında fikir alışverişi yapılmasını isteyen bir tip.  Dövüş sistemine gelirsek oyun burada gerçekten işi senin tercihine bırakıyor. Birçok farklı build, sayısız silah seçeneği ile seçenekler çok geniş. Soulslike oyunlarına alışık değilseniz savaşırken yüzlerce kez ölebilirsiniz fakat mantığı oturttuktan sonra her şey kolaylaşıyor. Seviye mantığı olduğu için çok tokat yersen seviye kasıp gelme şansın var.  Sekiro'da dövüş hissiyatı kat kat daha iyiydi, elinde kumanda değil de kılıç tutuyorsun hissiyatını verebiliyordu. Elden Ring'de kesinlikle böyle bir seviye beklemeyin. Sekiro'dan sonra ağaç kesiyormuşsun hissiyatı veriyor.  Müzik konusunda ise [i]yeterli[/i] diyebilirim. Gerçekten epik bir savaşa girdiğini hissettirmeyi başarsa bile sonradan açıp dinleyeceğim bir albümü yok bence.  Bazı yorumlarda optimizasyondan bahsedilmiş fakat ben R5 5600x ve RX 6600 XT sistemimle maksimum ayarlarda fps düşüşü yaşamadan oynadım.  Sonuç olarak keşfedilmeye fazlasıyla değer bir dünya, oynadığım en akılda kalıcı oyunlardan biri.
I love this game and everything about it definitely a cop
Happy birthday Elden Ring, you're officially a year old now! :)   But as an actual review, this game got me through one of the toughest times of my life, and it's surely done the same for others. Based on the amount of time I've put into the game, it's clear that I very much enjoy it, and I genuinely could not recommend it to others enough.   Get invested in the world, love the characters, struggle and learn the move sets of the bosses and enjoy the banger soundtrack, because this game's one hell of a ride you're never gonna forget.
yeah its good I guess
mama mai do i need to wawa your sandwich
Its not hard at all. (ㆆ_ㆆ)

Could this be... dog?
First souls-like game I played to completion, and loved EVERY second of it. One of the best games I have ever played, inspired me to go back and check out the rest of the souls games! (and let me tell you, I am doing MUCH better in them this time!)
[i]Thee[/i] sauce that once entered in the fair, cannot be beat.
After an initial try on the game, I thought it was too hard and that there was no use in playing it, but then I realized that I was just being a bitch. go play the game you spent 60 bucks on.
shadow wizard money gang we love casting spells
Like fortnite vr but no guns
I did not play any Souls-Like game before Elden Ring and I had no expectations how awesome the game would actually be. My hardest gaming addiction yet. Really glad I played it. 100% recommendable even for players without Souls experience. 
This game is absolutely awsome.
goodf
Elden ring type game
Lousiest game I ever purchased. Tried to return it but I played for two hours they say. No story at all.
There's very few ways I could talk about this game that are unique or interesting, because enough ink's been spilled that even reviewing it feels trite. I've been following Fromsoft games for the better part of a decade, starting with buying Demon's Souls way back in 2011, just before Dark Souls dropped on the PS3.   So I'll start by stealing words from someone who's smarter than I am, specifically Noah Caldwell-Gervais: "Elden Ring is not a perfect game, but it is idiosyncratic, which is almost as good and just as rare."  It's pretty remarkable that From Software's brand of animation timing-based combat, meticulous level design and striking art direction and tone not only translates to the open world format but even makes it truly worthwhile and interesting. The map is huge, but I still know its peaks and valleys, sheer cliff faces and miserable swamp lands like the back of my hand; I was concerned that the expansion of scope would mean it would be harder to get an idea of the layout of the Lands Between just because of its sheer breadth.  That's not the case because its layout is still every bit as crafted as any other fromsoft map. Sheer cliff faces from a map that dares you to traverse its landscape, jagged rock like fingers reaching out, as though the land itself wants to grab you, swallow you whole. I've never seen an open world so fearlessly use its verticality to limit the player's exploration and force you to find a way around. Sure there are games with taller skyscrapers, bigger mountains, but there's a difference between something being tall and something feeling tall. You can take an elevator to the top floor, but it means a lot more if you had to drag yourself around Mount Gelmir's smoking caldera.   It's embedded in my mind, every inch, every facet, every corpse in Caelid, every freestanding structure in Liurnia...and yet despite how much I know, there's still so much I missed. It took me a year to find out about Albinauric pots, and I only looked it up because I got smacked by one when I was invading!   Fromsoft has never been afraid to just hide things from the player; these games are utterly indifferent about whether or not you find every single item or every nook and every cranny and it makes me wish more titles were willing to just let the player miss things. I had a friend who had no idea there was an entire sector, a massive drop by an NPC just barely hidden; a huge chunk of a necropolis you can only visit towards the endgame.   There are maybe a few complaints to be made about how the combat is put together (and there are degenerate playstyles out there, but that's kind of inevitable in a game with this much breadth), but I still think it's by far some of the best that Fromsoft has made. I would argue it's even better than Bloodborne's combat loop, partially because you don't have to hunt for vials, partially because there's just more variety.   I won't go into the boss fights, mostly because you will know how Fromsoft's combat rhythm is if you play any of the other games. I would go so far as to say this is probably fromsoft's best boss lineup in a base game. If that sounds like hearsay, do keep in mind that even DS3 had way less consistency in boss quality, DS2's base lineup is truly terrible, and DS1 had both bosses that were kind of jank and a lot who were just...not very good. That's not even getting into DeS' lineup which is truly rough after 15 years of iteration. ER doesn't share that problem in its main lineup. Like, frankly the remembrance bosses, several of the optional fights, are all pretty consistently interesting to fight (save some truly insufferable lingering hitboxes. Looking at you, Fallingstar Beast.)  Elden Ring is three Dark Souls games stapled together, laid in a map with combat that takes queues from Sekiro and build variety that even exceeds DS2. It says a lot that even now, a year into this game's life cycle, I am still getting invades.   I mean I'm not exactly going to convince anyone who wasn't already looking at this game and I'm not really gonna be swayed by discourse because I've had a long, long time to percolate my thoughts.   ER good, actually. Basically.
I know my 4 hours are not much but I have roughly 800 on console. This is possibly one of my favorite games of all time, though it definitely takes some getting used to compared to something like CoD. Very fun, amazing looking (cutscenes can be somewhat goofy but never bad), the flow of fights are amazing and it's always fun no matter if I'm starting a new character/build or grinding on my main. To people immediately put off by the difficulty I severely recommend you spend a good bit of time trying more. This game has many ways it can be played and youtube videos are always your friend if you are stuck. 15/10 worth the price.
11/10, Dung Eater is best waifu May chaos take the world

Without a doubt the greatest piece of art ever conjured by the hand of man.

This is the Dark Souls II that FromSoft WANTED to make, as opposed to the one we actually got. It has many of the same annoyances—gank-heavy enemy placements, questionable hitboxes, a lot of fights seemingly being designed with only one strategy in mind—but it also corrects many of the worst aspects of DS2, and you actually get an entire continent to explore instead of a convolution of impossible spaces. If you liked DS2, you'll probably like ER—and if you didn't like DS2, as I and so many others didn't, there's still a very good chance you'll like ER anyway.  It's not a perfect game. The open world GENERALLY avoids feeling boring and empty like in many other open-world games—but some areas still feel like a slog. Enemy strength scales by area, just like in Dark Souls, not according to your level or equipment, which makes exploring some areas a bit more frustrating, but you can always hop on Torrent for a quick getaway—though that only applies to certain definitions of "quick," because Torrent feels like the slowest horse in video games and turns like a boot. Still, he can double-jump, which allows for some interesting routes.  All in all, though, this is the best Soulslike I've played. I didn't think I'd like it better than DS1, but it exceeded my expectations. But this long after it came out, are you really still looking at reviews to decide whether you want to buy it?
There are certain things in life that you must accomplish in order to become a man. Beating this game is one of them.
Could this be, dog?

Elden Ring was my first Souls Game ever. While it was really hard to get into (I had dropped it for months due to Margit), I can say without a doubt, Elden Ring is a great experience as a non-souls gamer. Once I got passed Margit and the Stormveil castle, everything went uphill from there. I recommend this game to non-souls gamers as their first souls game due to the amount of freedom the game gives you to find the build best suited for you. 10/10, definitely one of my top favorites. I'm planning on playing Dark Souls 3 as my next souls game.
Decent
Open world "Souls" type of game, what more is there to say? Pretty decent game.
I give this 10 vins out of 10 diesels
Awesome game.
fun
get gud
otimo, mas dark souls 2 é melhor
- Story Good. - Gameplay Good. - Difficulty Good.  Recommend Purchase!
Just get it and become an Elden Lord, you Tarnished!
good game. lots of things to do
GOTY nothing else to say. Maybe Game of the Decade.
plin plin plon
help

game is sick, atmospheric storytelling at its best. Just an unbelievable masterpiece of fantasy world building combined with the culmination of combat refinement that delivers the most fast paced and versatile combat we have seen from fromsoft to this point. 10/10 its one of the top 3 games I have ever played and one that I can continue to play after beating it. New builds, classes ect ect this game is quite simply, the shit.
This game made me fall in love in the souls series, and I didn't like Souls games before. Thank you Fromsoft <3 
Piss and shit magic go
Do I recommend this game? Yes and no. Why the "no"? It's not a game meant for everyone, and I mean that. It is a challenging game, and can be extremely frustrating at times. However, if you like to be challenged, if you enjoy the feeling after overcoming a difficult fight, then this is for you.   The lore is not an in your face type of story. You've got to do some digging. I suggest reading item descriptions, it goes a LONG way in clarifying the story, as well as exploring and going off the beaten path. As someone who played DS3 (a LOT), I absolutely love this game and the story. It's dark, gritty, and most of all sad; but it is compelling. It draws you in and throws you for a loop.  Gameplay wise, it runs smoothly, and I have no issues. Controls are nearly the same as Dark Souls 3 (with the addition of jumping). I don't suffer from my game CTD'ing (crash to desktop) or anything.  In terms of style of play, there are a lot of different builds. More than just the spell slinger or sword and board styles. It's fun, interesting and I enjoy the freedom of it. Some builds (scarlet rot/bleed) are OP, that mainly applies to multiplayer/pvp and less so for solo play.   Overall, is it worth the pricetag on it? Absolutely, worth the buy.
Amazing open world game. Tough enemies just like the other FromSoftware games, but this one has the ability to farm or simply go elsewhere when you get stuck. Very dense as far as content, every corner you turn has the potential to be a dungeon/boss encounter with a cool item.
Still crashes and frame drops in certain parts, but it's good.
I mean, the game is great and all, but suddenly i start getting these insane FPS stutters that i can't fix which makes it unplayable.  I can see on the internet that a lot of others have the same problem, but no one knows how to fix it.
I won.
Definitely deserves game of the year
It's gud
10/10 died over 9000 times
hard as fuck
Ticks every box i likes and even manage to be , ( in my humble opinion ) more accessible to casual players than the dark souls serie. Just remember , if you cant overcome an obstacle in the moment , you can always come back later , this IS an open world after all.
I haven't played this game. but looks good ig
Great game especially for Souls fans, I just wish the game didn't take so long to finish ...
it's a masterpiece, nuff said
Masterpiece.
Pro: game looks pretty Cons: huge empty map, pointless "quests", barely any npcs, the UI is as trash as always on PC, horrible to navigate in the menus; typical souls-style game  6/10 at best
don't recommend. if you buy this game, say goodbye to social interaction. THIS is your new world. THIS is your life now
ez 1 attempt ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
yes
fun
yes
its cool and awesome and stuff
Genuinely amazing
I did it for Hewg
good shit
The best From Software Game to-date. I hope that a dlc will come^^
i love it  
Great game however unable to sex Malenia makes it mid
Fun game if you like a challenge and don't mind dying a lot :)
great game
Love this game Stay away from seamless coop mod unless you want to get banned. They claim it doesnt violate TOS but i was definitely banned for "modifying files".
.
Except for making me suicidal, this game's great.
The combat of this game is perfect it blends all the best aspects of every souls game into the best combat in any of the games by far the reason I dont recommend this game is the empty open world full of copy pasted areas and bosses and more reused bosses than Dark Souls 2 by ALOT also enemy bosses or just enemies the game thinks are cool cant fall off ledges they just walk into invisible walls. If these things dont matter to you then get this game it is fun while in combat otherwise very boring this game would have been perfect 10/10 if you got rid of the empty open world garbage and replaced them with areas that exist for a reason not just to look pretty for photo mode
10 out of 10. Loves it
A great game, I took me quite a while to truly get into it but once I did it's an experience unmatched by any other game I have played. Exploring is truly wonderful as you never know where you'll end up next.
Maidens not included
cool and very hard
Cant Fuck Ranni. 0/10
All I feel is pain        But strongly recommend
good soup  
surely they'll announce the dlc after the 1 year anniversary, right? what do you mean "copium"?  welp 
A beautiful graphic game with brilliant fight scenes. A game that pushes a gamer to his limits with skills.
Fortnite crossover?
Very Elden Ring like

Awesome game with incredible landscapes and difficult enemies!
I like dying
Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.
muito legau 
Good game!
nice
Bosses: unavoidable attacks, perfect tracking, never ending combos that last for years and attacks that can lead into other attacks. This game has some of the most frustrating design I've ever seen in a From Soft game. Feels a lot more like a statement than it does an enjoyable video game.  Open world is really cool but it means you're always going to be over geared or over leveled for half the game. Don't bother unless you're doing co-op (which case I'd recommend the Seamless Co-op mod since it uses the same outdated co-op design from the other dark souls games, as well as you can't use the horse in multiplayer).
Broadsword is the sexiest armament!
best game
best game in the wolrd
finger, but hole
Fabulous epic.
elden ring is the first souls like game i have really played. this game can be brutally difficult, ridiculously easy, and ridiculously deep in lore and story. but even following the story can be a challenge in itself. you have to look at the description of every thing you find to piece the story together like a detective. there are a ton of different endings. there is even an infinite number of ways to play this game. you cannot win this game creating a swiss army knife character. you have to find a path build around it. every discipline has its own specializations. for instance a faith build can specialize in lightning, fire, holy or bestial... you can create builds around specific things and they will work. brilliant game.
YES, buy it - play it! That's it, that's the review.
no need for explanation, if you've played dark souls 3 and enjoyed it then this is the game for you
not as good as bloodborne and ds3 on par with ds1, 9.2 out of 10
very nice
Challenging yet enjoyable. Amazing details and artwork. Immersive as f*ck. The only downside to the game is there is not much sense of direction and would have been nice to have some markers beside the direction a site of grace is pointing towards. 9/10
Massive open world adventure that has become a cultural phenomena.
this game gives me lotions on my dick and makes me horny as fuck like im a freak man like holly fuck
You don't have the right, oh You don't have the right...
bad game
good
I struggled to get into this at first not having played any of the previous games. Now I cannot stop playing it.
great game
Dark souls? who that
mmmm yes indeed 

I beaten John Eldenring and I have immortalized my time in this review

I'll start off by saying I've been enjoying Dark Souls since DS1. Fromsoft makes some excellent games and this game is good, but my negative review comes from a few things I don't enjoy and I don't think the series needed.  We didn't need a open world. It's as wide as an ocean and shallow as a puddle. I prefer the old linear experience that Dark Souls has always provided. I also stand that I wish we could get back to the inter connectivity that DS1 demonstrated so excellently.  I become incredibly disappointed when I clear a side dungeon only to fight a boss I previously killed. It ruins the excitement of finding something new only to experience something old. The reuse of bosses in this game kills the experience for me.  The boss design is also another factor in my review. I've always been a hyper aggressive player. I look for openings in between attacks while still being able to roll dodge as well. I'm aggressive and hate playing passive. I enjoy optimizing and looking for zero downtime if possible. That said, these bosses will string together a Marvel Vs Capcom string for 30 seconds and I'm just stuck standing away and looking at the boss like I'm stupid. After that string they have almost zero downtime and begin to run the string once again. It's not fun to constantly be dodging for 30+ seconds only to maybe hit once or twice.   In closing, we sacrificed quality for quantity. The game has the highest highs of the series followed by devastatingly low lows that ruin it for me.
Best game
Not sure what to say that likely hasn't been said. I've never played a "souls-like" before this one and, while there's definitely a learning curve, there's something so satisfying about finally beating that enemy. There are virtually unlimited ways to play from the massive amounts of items, weapons, spells, gear, etc plus customization of your character and their skills. The world is absolutely massive with more secrets and questlines than you could ever hope to discover or complete. The messaging system was weird to me at first as I'm the type of player that loves to discover everything on my own, but I think it actually adds to the game due to the sheer volume of secrets. If a lot of the messages weren't there I'd probably have half the gear I have now and still be stuck somewhere in Limgrave. 11/10 and I haven't even finished my first playthrough yet.  And that's all without even talking about how breathtakingly beautiful this game is.
10/10
Fairly hesitant as a non-soulsbourne player to even pick this up, but as a sucker for the perfect approach to open world games and the great critic reviews I gave it a try.  It turned out to be top 3 of any game I ever played.  - Beautiful world - Deep moving story and character lore - Fantastic OST - Excellent voice acting and great boss voice lines - Loads of locations to explore, bosses to fight, non-intuitive quest lines to pursue and gear, weapons, spells etc. to perfect your build.  The entire game is surrounded in a sense of melancholy that makes the entire experience of this game deserving of the praise as a masterpiece by design, lore and direction.  10/10 - Perfect
Awesome game. True love and care taken to produce this, totally deserved Game of the Year!!
Good
Game of the Year 2023  Best game that truly made me feel something. Even that something was fear, doubt, uncertain and anxious and finally conquering that fear made me move forward as a person. Definitely recommend for all people who love a challenge and work on themselves to overcome those challenges.  There are mods available to make the experience easier for you. I recommended a co-op mod that makes it easier to play without invasions and easy mode mod that makes the game little bit easy for your skills. I do recommend checking the game out without mods first and try different builds(There are a lot of busted builds)  FromSoft have truly outdone themselves with this game. Dark souls was always unforgiving and a depressing world i could never get into. Things don't make sense in dark souls in a common sense perspective and how alien the world building is. The same is true for Elden Ring but it's a lot less and oh my god the game is gorgeous. Elden Ring is the most newbie friendly souls game.   Don't listen to internet people who dictate how to enjoy or play or live your life. It's just a game and having fun is the most important part. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
New fav game.
Game's hard af. especially with a bad build. watch a build guide, the game will still be super difficult though. essentially just know what you're doing idk man. SUPER fun overall, my favorite Fromsoft game for sure(alongside sekiro)! Play it, you won't regret it.... probably :)
attack the tree sentinel
yes. buy it. you wont regret it.
Great experience and great open world, I just have one small tiny issue, I wish there wasn’t so much suffering 👍  As this is sorta my introduction to souls games (besides a bit of sekiro), I can confidently say I will never buy another 👍👍👍
it is very good! Like I would definitely consider it GOTY.   It is hard and I would recommend Dark Souls 1 to play first at least, because it is also a very good game.   The best comparison I could make is that it is like if you liked a rock musician and their first album was very compelling and their view is very prominent in their music. Later in their career they have been set up in their tropes and ideas and they have worked very hard to progress, but it maybe is not as gripping as their first album.
It's ELDEN RING
Play this game when you feel like a loser.... you will be a true loser but you will be learnt how to deal with problem, how to stand up when you fall and know to believe in yourself xD
Yes
fun game 
10/10
I've died more to falling off cliffs than dying to actual bosses. 10/10 love this game.
good game
Decent
One of the best of all time.
Gotta say this game is pretty amazing. It's so good in fact, that I played too much and failed one of my classes lmao
Epic games. Can see why it got game of the year. Wish I had more time to play it.
Game is the best souls like in my opinion, its fun, has open world, a crafting system, a horse you can ride, dragon powers and lots more bosses an cool weapons. love the game!
COOL
Great open world, amazing gameplay, truly an amazing experience, reminds me of witcher 3 but much harder.
One of the best games i've played in years, story, gameplay, visuals and difficulty are mixed perfectly for hundreds of hours of gameplay make this game a 10/10. id recommend watching beginners guide to start otherwise it will be overwhelming at first.
Good game
Don't Do it. You'll never get out alive.
elden RANG!!!
YEA
I am maidenless and tarnished
For some reason i frkn love this game, Its the skryrm i never got to play or something i just luv it
BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful a very good follow up to Sekiro <3 especially if Sekiro was your first Souls-Bourne game. Highly recommend if you're looking for the challenge!
Good
elden ring O elden ring
amazing and challenging !  would dine again!
knights hot
Whats better than two hands? Four!     I spend sleepless nights thinking about Ranni
I like the new gameplay elements I've encountered, and it's nice to step away from the worlds of the Dark Souls games. I've loved it so far, and will continue to play for years to come. Thanks, From Software dev team!
Amazing challenge with memorable bosses
Great Game
great lore!
Every emotion balled up into one. No other game comes close to keeping you enthralled.
poop ring
i hate this game
First an foremost, I absolutely suck at video games and I have never played a souls game...  With that said, i loved this game. I have had the most fun playing it, and have yet to break my controller. I can't think of anything truly negative to say.
Amazing game but I suk
i can safely say this is a masterpiece
This game is literally crack
As someone who tried one Dark Souls games years ago and bounced off pretty quickly, I found Elden Ring a better introduction to this kind of game. It took me a while to grasp all the systems and get used to the combat style, but it's also very satisfying once you start to get the hang of it. This game is more about patience than power initially--a feature that I've grown to love in the late game. I also enjoy the multiplayer (especially the co-op) and have loved playing with friends who have been deeper into Fromsoft games than me. They've taught me a lot about to game systems and approach combat, plus it's fun to destroy invaders!
Tough but fun!
Its hard but worth it in the end
Hella addicting ngl
TOGETHAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
oh god, don't buy it. This game will eat your life away I swear, this game is a world of its own. you could spend a whole day in the game not doing the story I swear there is that much content in the game is CRAZY.
Fantastic game! You can tell there has been a lot of heart poured into making this world and all the living (and dead) things in it!
Primarily a sword+magic user, this game brought me so much strife, and I loved every second. Fully recommend, and now im trying (mods) and it just gets better and better.
the game is really easy if you keep your health bar above 0
GUD STUFF
It's amazing. You kill stuff and then you die. Would kill/die again. 10/10.
Its from soft. nuf said
Should be game of the year, every year, for the rest of time.
Amazing game, love the story!
Great 
it guud
GRAPE!
My first souls game and probably one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10 W game
Es el GOTY, nada mas que decir.
Games is great, but would be better if I didn't always need to have a guide open to see what I'm supposed to do next.
super good
It's like Breath of the Wild except dark, gory and awesome.
Good lord this game is the most...                                                ... easy thing I have ever played.

this game is very difficult but very fun
hell yes
not bloodborne, but it does have a cool wolf guy. 10/10
good
possibly one of the most game ever
It's just kinda okay? It's open world ds3 which is the same game as ds2 which is the same game as ds1 which is the same game as demon's souls, if you like any of those 4 games you'll probably like this one.
Never played a Soul's like game. This is incredible, there is so much to do, so many build you can do, etc. There is a reason this game won GOTY. 10/10 will play again.
Nothing has come close to the enjoyment I have had playing this game.
The game is amazing. I don't know why I waited a whole year after the game came out to finally play it.
dog
I'm married, but still maidenless. :(
this game was too hard ;( im saddd1!!!
No PlayStation button prompts. It states that it has full controller support but it's only xbox controller support. The game has already released on PlayStation. It's hardly a 1 hour job to get the PlayStation prompts into the PC game and it will relieve many players.
maybe the best game ever
Challenging at first, don't give up on it.
Hard with some somewhat unfair boss mechanics, but if you give it enough effort, you'll get through it.
Exceeded my high expectations. Some problems with the storytelling, but overall, what a great game. I wish I could forget it and discover it again.  Hopefully, dlc is coming soon !
it is a game that you really feels RPG mecanics on it.
This game is a mix of adventure and broken controllers would buy again
Simply gorgeous. Beautiful world to explore, Combat is an improvement on multiple fronts from DS3, no hand holding really makes the exploration feel meaningful. This game definitely has something for every play style. Praise the sun!

Never played a souls game before. Game is very good, highly recommend~
ngl this jawn slaps
Masterpiece
She Malenia'ed on my blade until I Miquella'd
good game
boop
If you haven't played this play it.    If you have played it do so again. This is what a good game looks like.
Fun game, once it starts to get easy challenge runs are very simple
As a new player of Souls and Soul like games, this is wonderful. A lush world filled with hidden secrets and it is much more than meets the eye. The way the game makes you feel is simply amazing, although I am still a bit confused on the dodge feature and the first boss is very painful. but I love exploring and I am truly excited to become strong enough to smite the first boss of my first run.
Best from soft game
a Very open world and replenish able experience in a game ever
This isnt Monopoly
can not touch grace
I'm addicted.
An amazing game from the design and until the bosses and the gameplay overhaul is amazing. When I start playing this game, I play for tons of time without even realizing, something that doesn't happen to me in a lot of games, so thats just show how truely amazing this game really is. I highly suggest you buy and play this game; it's worth the money, believe me.
I love this game. Fantastic. Just the best.
Big dog, near lake, seek his wisdom

I aint playing this game for any longer than 2 hours 
Is good
Really addictive
27 hours for the first boss, 200 left 10/10 would smash my left nut again !
very fun to play many things to do
My favorite game. Very pretty. very fun, i love exploring the world with my silly little character
W game
Best souls-like of them all
probably the game ever
very hard but very fun first souls game
game of the year
exactly what you expect when you hear open world dark souls. best one yet
Game of year
I mean, as you can see 650+ hours into the game, it's okay I guess. Nah, really fun, good PVP meta/builds, high replay-ability factor, collecting gear and doing various questlines that can only be completed once per playthrough allows it to be a very good bang-for-buck game, 9/10 overall.
One of the best games ever made
While I am terrible at the game, I really enjoy playing! It is one of the best games I have ever played!
Memorize move-set and PARRY!!!
You died Git gud You died Git gud  Put those foolish ambitions to rest...  .... I am Malenia... I am Malenia... I am Malenia... ....  Well then, shall we? My fair consort eternal.  10/10
fuck yeah
If you want to constantly die - this would be a great game. Otherwise, do not waste your money
very good
Best Game
Very Gud
Arhhghggghghg god I love Rum, and this game only reminds me of how much RUM means to me. If you are a fellow rum enjoyer then this game is just for you. There was not a single boss that couldn't be enjoyed with a side of RUM, it's just that epic sauce
its ok
Friendship ended with Dark Souls 3. Now Elden Ring is my best friend.
This is a beautiful game, tons to explore and do.
goty 202x
Str go bonk
every 10 minutes I come across a wall I have to get over. so i watch some you tube videos on spells turns out spent my points wrong. so i spend 2 days on one area rinse and repeat. still gonna play i tho
Refunded this game 3 times but ended up keeping it
good ive played it on diffrent things so i have like 356 hours its good
good
pog
Great game to bonk your problems away
Most approachable Souls game so far. Great for veterans and newcomers alike. One of the best games I've played in a long time. Would absolutely recommend
good game, this generations version of Skyrim in a way. 10/10 would recommend, you will play this game for years. don't skimp out on watching youtube videos for help the games huge. its nice to know what you want to do and how to not mess up any story progression or ways to obtain certain weapons for yourself.
It's all fun till you cross the 50h border
Good game
buy it!
is hard but very fun the boss fights are 10/10 but god dying a lot is very annoying but i love the game.
great souls experience
for my first souls like it was amazing. If you want it to be easy you can but if you want it to be hard it can be too. 10/10
best open-world game i have ever played
Great game for all. Difficult but manageable for most I would say.
I mean the only thing is is that it's pretty hard
Interesting
Do not ever be eating the crawdads they got in Liurnia of the Lakes, I have not left the shitter in days.
Thoroughly enjoyed the game! Lots of build potential for many play styles, I mostly stick to the level 40/60 ranges and find them to be my favorite for helping people with boss/dungeon progress, even if they aren't meta. Hard to really point myself anywhere specific for pros and cons, but I find myself playing way longer than I'd normally intend.
Its Elden Ring need i say more
Great game if you love exploring a vast world with a ton of interesting things and lore to find. It's definitely a game that wants YOU to piece together the world as you play, which in my opinion, is a masterclass in storytelling elements. It took me about 150 hours to beat it with one character and that was with pretty heavy exploration. Even after all of that time, there are still many things to find and I'm still finding neat new stuff even after beating it. This game is pretty hard, especially if you aren't used to the gameplay style. Returning FromHeads will feel right at home in The Lands Between. Tip for newbies: Use a shield or make sure to jump attack often if you're dual wielding and don't be afraid to rely on summoning a Spirit Ash or other players. This game is a wonderful addition to the FromSoft lineup and to me is the second best game in there second only to Dark Souls 1. I was pleasantly surprised it replaced Demon's Souls as my #2
Foul Tarnished!!
SEKIRO is better
Shit jank wit it
To say this game is just big dark souls is actually fairly accurate, but I do think there is more to it then just that. For one I feel as though the souls format transitioned into the open world format quite well with the way they tell stories, and with how the previous souls games have taught it's players to look for secrets everywhere. Elden Ring's world is just teeming with things to find! In fact I feel as though Elden Ring has done something that many other open world games have failed at, which is making the player WANT to explore everywhere, and rewarding the player for doing so with things like weapons, spells, armor, charms. extra bosses, and even hidden quests, and stories! I would definitely recommended this game to anyone who in joys the souls format, or games with lots to see, and explore. Lets hope that FromSoft takes what they've learned from Elden Ring, and apply it to future games "cough" Bloodborne 2 'cough.'
This game is to good very addictive .because of game i didnt go school two weeks which you see on mi english

GoTY
I strongly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for an adventure and enjoys looking for things!  I have spent the last 11 hours of game play exploring, dying, killing, gathering, learning, and having fun overall.  I was unsure about this game when it first came out and was hesitant to pick it up.  I am glad that I bought the game and have had a chance to experience it! Even if you have never played a "souls" like game... you should give this a try.. very fun!   I have enjoyed the open play and open world.  You can explore and stumble upon things that will either kill you, bless you or reward you with items.  There are many different npcs to discover, mobs that you can easily kill or come back to when you are stronger.  The world is amazing!  You can hear the ocean waves crash against the shore, the thunder of water against the cliffs, you can actually see whitecaps and waves make their way to the shore.  I still have much to discover and do.   You get a selection of classes to play that can be customized to fit your own style so there is no "cookie cutter" build.  You get to choose how you want to play your given class and the weapons, skills etc.  If you want to be a magic wielding rogue, it looks like it could be done.  I am not sure how viable or survivable it would be but you have the option to do as you please.    I really have no negative things to say about this game.  I have only just started the game... keep your eyes & ears open. Be alert and if you die... you die.  Make sure to level up every chance you get.. don't hoard your souls you may get caught off guard by a big bad boss and not have a way to retrieve them. It is a risk you take!  Just play & have fun!
i like
this is my first time playing a souls game, I am 60 hours in and enjoyed every second of it. i have played many games like it just to name a few with the same style, god of war 4, assassins creed, and star wars Jedi fallen order. if you like any of those games this is the one for you though if you have a small temper and rage a lot I would not recommend but give it try.
Nothing special. Nothing groundbreaking or supercool. Just a decent game.
Masterpiece
Died, died, and died again.
Incredible game, it's probably the best game I've ever played. I take that back, it is the best game I've ever played. This game is full of action and exploration, I haven't even discovered everything and I have over a hundred hours in it. Elden Ring is the hardest game I've ever played, I think if I played the Souls games I would have had more experience. After playing Elden Ring you get better at other games, and it's like other games aren't even a challenge anymore. The game almost made me cry, it made me happy, angry, and surprised. The enemy's are crazy, either they make you laugh because you weren't expecting them, or they make you want to throw your controller out a window. I don't even know how you make a game like Elden Ring, it has everything you would expect and things you wouldn't expect. I am very happy I got this game, and I hope they make more games like this one.
Before I played this, I had a small wee wee, no girlfriend and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
10/10 would defeat Malenia again
absolute masterpiece
old ring
Gods fighting noobs get gud or uninstall
OMY GOD THE GAME IS SO EASY IF YOU USE THE BOLT OF GRANSAX
Love it
awesome game and it deserved the GOTY. sometimes i feel like i have walked into a painting while playing this
Elden Ring, developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco, has been eagerly anticipated by fans of the studio's previous games, such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. From early impressions and gameplay footage, Elden Ring appears to deliver on the studio's signature style of challenging gameplay, immersive worlds, and cryptic storytelling.  One of the most notable aspects of Elden Ring is its open-world design, which is a departure from the more linear levels of FromSoftware's previous titles. This new approach promises to provide players with a greater sense of exploration and discovery as they venture through the game's expansive environments.  In addition, Elden Ring features a deep and complex lore, which has become a hallmark of FromSoftware's games. The game's story is said to be written in collaboration with renowned fantasy author George R.R. Martin, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the game's narrative.  Elden Ring also boasts a range of new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to mount and ride various creatures, adding a new dimension to exploration and combat. The game's combat system, which is a staple of FromSoftware's games, has been refined and expanded upon, with new weapons, spells, and abilities to master.  Overall, Elden Ring appears to be a promising addition to FromSoftware's impressive catalog of games. With its open-world design, deep lore, and refined gameplay mechanics, the game is sure to appeal to fans of the studio's previous titles as well as newcomers to the genre.  (made with Open AI because im lazy, but ya its a super good game, definitely should play)
Its a great game
Feeling empty once the game has been completed. It was nonetheless a pleasant experience. Highly recommendable.
Yes
One of the best games I've ever played, hands down. I was always a multiplayer FPS games type of person, and this game has sucked me in the Souls atmosphere. I recommend this to anyone who is up for the challenge, who is willing to rage, cry, and scream. Trust me, it is worth the struggle!
It was me, I was the one writing all those "hidden path ahead" messages.
It's a Master Piece. One of the best game in my life. Loved it a lot.
It's epic, yo
keeps on suprising me with how large it is
I am Melenia Blade of Miquella
pepe und kaki in pepe kaka land
Easily the best Souls game.
Is it good? Yes, very good. My 1st playthrough was a wonderful experience, but on my 3rd I really started to see the flaws. Suprisingly small amount of replay value - I started kinda rushing through everything - since such a large part of the game is optional, I ended up skipping parts of it/dreading to go through them again since I kinda knew everything already. That feeling of suprise and discovery is what drives exploration in your 1st playthrough, but once that's done, it just becomes boring as hell. Also the lategame and some of the bosses are just atrocious. Still living a blue thumbs up, because it ate me the hell up and ruined my life for like 3 weeks. Consecutive playthroughs are definetly weaker though.
one of, if not the best RPGs i have ever played. remember to put this on your ssd because you might die a couple times.
10/10 would recommend it
rivers of blood go woosh woosh woosh
best 60 euro spent of my life
For me, this is top 3 the best games of all time
Absolute masterpiece!
Never have played such a captivating game. I felt like a kid again with exploring new areas and fighting new bosses. I have not had this much fun since I was in high school.
good game
Best RPG game ever
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella
make sure you have this game on your ssd because you will die more than you kill the enemies
good
Superb  Easily the game of the year 2022 Very beautiful and challenging
It's good.
good game
eldened my ring
fun game.
Tengo que confesar que era reticente a comprarme el juego. Ya había jugado al Dark Soul y lo había acabado dejando. La alta dificultad y la dinámica de "morir y volver a intentarlo" me resultaba un tanto frustrante. Lo cual no deja de ser curioso teniendo en cuenta que crecí jugando a juegos como Megaman, Contra, Ninja Gaiden, etc. que se basaban precisamente en eso. Será la edad ... Creo que el gran acierto de Elden Ring es combinar lo mejor de los Dark Souls con un mundo abierto. Esa libertad que te da un gigantesco mundo abierto permite que cuando te quedes atascado con una quest, puedas avanzar en otra distinta, explorar una zona pendiente, o tratar de acabar con ese dragón que te estaba dando quebraderos de cabeza hace unos días. Ello hace que el juego sea más gratificante de lo habitual. Ello, junto con varias mejoras a nivel técnico y de mecánicas, es lo que, en mi opinión, sublima la fórmula "Dark Souls" en este juego hasta convertirlo en una Obra Maestra.  
I'll just quote the review closest to my own opinion - 'An excellent game that warmed me to up to the souls-like genre. The exploration of the open world is very satisfying and the combat is challenging but fair. After 200 hours, I can say that not understanding the story at all did not dampen my enjoyment of the game.'
This is a masterpiece of a game !
awesome game
I got more hours played coz played mostly offline. I couldnt get into 1st dark souls and i gave up on trying any other souls coz im mostly casual person but i liked how this game looked and decided to give it a try.  It was very hard at first but slowly i managed to beat first bosses from small dungeons and before i noticed i was spending alot time ingame. Best feature for me was that i didnt had to fight boss to continue playing, if something was too hard i always could go and do other things to get stronger and return more prepared. Aftter getting better at game i even started to beat stuff without help of summon spirits and it felt super awesome to achive that.  Its not perfect game and it got its flaws but its very fun to play and i enjoyed it way more than expected.
ohhh elden ring..
Fingerprint stone shield + Bull goat armor > Malenia
yes
it good game 
good game
Foreskin Duo
The game is absolutely stunning. Definitely in my top 5 ever. If I had one complaint it's the keyboard/mouse functionality is terrible. I did however beat the game using it because I personally would never use a controller. I have never written a review for any game but was so blown away by how good this was that I wanted to write one. Amazing!!
Fun
f
This was my first fromsoft game and i was not disappointed. The game is 10/10 on story and game play. the lore to this universe is deep and very entertaining. give it a chance and few more after words and i promise it wont disappointing. Elden Ring is a true gamer's game!
Amazing game!
this game reminds of me of a certain...anime/manga... that starts with the letter B and ends with the letter K   overall  10/10 game   (couldnt beat it without my Sean tho<3)   recommend this BEAUTIFUL LOVELY GAME to you AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL  -safe travels tarnished-
truly an amazing day, i would recommend this game to anyone. ps: i have 100+ hours on mu ps5 and its still super fun

the true Demon's Souls starts here
2011 saw the release of two of the most influential games for the RPG genre, Dark souls and Skyrim. One was a complex and mysterious game, with some of the greatest level designs in modern gaming and the other was an adventure through a seemingly limitless fantasy world. Both were fantastic games in their own right, but even back then I always dreamed of a Skyrim with the addictive combat and difficulty of dark souls, and likewise I dreamed of a dark souls that had the sandbox freedom of Skyrim.  Fast forward to 2022 and this dream has been realised. The open world element of Elden Ring reinvigorates the souls-like core gameplay. The great level design and inter connectivity of dark souls is still here, and so is the great combat and progression. But now we have a huge open world full of secrets to uncover. In dark souls sometimes the difficulty could be suffocating, with your only option to “get gud” and grind your way through a cruel place like Sen’s Fortress. In Elden Ring when things get hard you can teleport across the map and set off in a direction of your choosing. Leveling up while uncovering lore rich dungeons and points of interest. It honestly never even feels like grinding.  This game still isn’t for everyone, if you’re looking for a game that is completely accessible and has the best graphics of the decade, this might not be it. But if you’re even slightly willing to give the souls-like combat a decent try, and if you love fantasy RPGs this is absolutely the best game of its kind since 2011.
big good
likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
W
amazing game
An amazing game from start to finish. I usually only play a game once or twice and let it sit in my library forevermore afterwords. I'm currently on my 5th Elden Ring playthrough. That should speak for its self.
This game is vile. Take everything that made souls enjoyable and strip it away for a unfair, mass market apeal slog that spits on the legacy of souls. What a desgrace.
First and only game i've 100%, yes, it's that good!
pretty game, but gameplay is forcibly primitive and ridiculously monotonous.  falls into that horrible JRPG trap of needing to grind way too much because being organic is too alien a concept for devs that peaked in the PS2 era.  only popular because of neckbeards that memorized the i-frames and found that the gameplay loop replaces the bubble wrap mommy stopped letting them pop a week before dark souls 1 came out.   opposite opinions are wrong.
ring of eldens
I haven't played spirit games before; it feels like all you do is explore before you get killed.  There really is little or no direction, and when there is - its ridiculously difficult; even non-bosses.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone new to this without a walk through; the game would be very had.  Having restarted with a Samurai, my recommendation is to not go Wrench no matter how much you want to being the underdog.  However if your looking for an addictive game to sink hours into, then its a candidate but you still need a walk through.  I cant recommend as a game - it has nothing on Skyrim or Witcher or DragonAge or MassEffect but I get if you like the soul games this would be ideal.  New to the game style, with a wrench 1/10, with a Samurai 5/10 I would give.  The thing I hate most about the game is loosing the runes, when in an unbeatable boss or dungeon - you cant retrieve them, I know the hardcore fans will love it.  But for me its just another lazy mechanic.  I think co-op play may be much better though than soloing it.  
too hard for my little fingers
Elden Ring cured my Crippling Bals
i love getting raped
Behold, Elden Ring! Ahhh... Beautiful...
The greatest of all time.
Fun
Made me feel some typa way
Goes hard
ermm margit called me foul, malenia keeps reminding me shes the blade of miquella, i can devour the gods with rykard, and blaidd + radahn are the perfect dog duo!!!
Elden Ring is the culminative mastering of Fromsoft's design for the past decade on top of treading new grounds in the form of an open world with horizontal progression compared to past games which were much more linear in design. It is unabashedly masterful in execution; it feels like the Soulsborne series was always meant to reach this.  By far this is the game where it is the easiest to get into; progression gating is very limited, most of the map is accessible without the need to defeat bosses. There is a plethora of play-styles that are viable; Miracle builds are now finally made viable, its on that level. The Spirit Ashes add a new option for solo play that's more available for players to use.  The story feels much more cohesive and fleshed out than any previous Fromsoft game that I have experienced. Not going to drop spoilers, but its amazing how things feel connected as you progress through the story.  There are a few prominent pain points. There is some reusing of bosses, which in an open world game is perfectly fine, however there are instances where they are poorly placed, such as two different instances of a boss enemy with different movesets in a small arena, which makes the encounter feel arbitrarily difficult. There are a few enemies that are less than enjoyable to fight as well, and there is a big difficulty spike in the later areas. However these are relatively minor flaws that can be circumvented.  Elden Ring feels like a childhood dream of adventure. Its easy to lose yourself to the adventure. Take it from me; game already ate up 100+ hours in the first week. To the veterans of the Soulsborne games, this is a worthwhile purchase. To the newcomers, this is probably the best first game for the series, it will take some learning but if you really want to get into souls games, this is one.
Elden Ring: Grind Or Prepare To Die Edition
this is the one, the best souls game ever made bar none, takes everything that worked in the older games and adds open world layouts and exploration to the mix and it just works, as per usuall there is alot of replayability and numerous builds that make subsequent playthroughs fun and engaging and the multiple endings add to that mix. in terms of diificulty this is the easiest one but that also works quite well cause clearly there is a nice balance beetwen having fun and learning vs dying 200 times per boss like you do in the impossibly hard Sekiro, maybe thats just me. price wise the game could have cost 100 bucks and would still be very much worth it due to the sheer amount of content and the intricacy of the open world. making long, massively harsh open worlds is the future of this genre and i hope Fromsoft keep this trend going, hell they could even just make expansions adding new areas with more bosses and plotlines for the next 10 years, im sure people would approve, im looking forward to the upcomming expansion for this one, 100% recommended to anyone that likes a well made game with an extremely rewarding gameplay loop. nothing i can say here hasnt already been said = get the game, its amazing.
great
Before playing this game, I wasn't even into fantasy/medieval type of stuff. BUT this game is perfect like literally outstanding. It's also my first souls-like/souls-bourne type of game and I genuinely enjoy playing this game. IT'S JUST TOO GOOD I SWEAR TO GOD. LITERALLY 10/10 AND I AM STILL MAIDENLESS. REMEMBER TO TRY FINGERS BUT HOLE!
Just an amazing game that I needed
bravo michael zaki
varre called me out for being maiden-less, now i got me a maiden. coincidence? def not.
steep learning curve, but fun nonetheless.
game is a masterpeice one of my fav
This is by far one of the best game I have played in my life.
Play if you like to cry
about to kill the elden beast on my first run and my first souls type game in general and kinda sad the rest of my time will be rune farming and pvp until the dlc but I cant believe it took me this long to give the game a try.
how do i beat margit
felt like a kid again getting hooked into games fro the first time
 It is a good game.
try finger but hole
best game ever
i forgot to review this game, very good
pros: it has the best exploration i've seen in a game, the bosses are amazing, over 100 hours of game play, amazing story telling and the music is amazing as it usually is in souls like games  cons: it gets a little bit laggy sometimes
20 million copies sold! wer DLC senpai
let me know that im a very patient man
Dark Souls 2 2: GRR Edition  28th of February, 2023:  THEY ANNOUNCED THE DLC, THE DLC IS REAL

I f**** hate this game.
Fantastic Game 10/10
Recommend for anyone who loves a fair challenge
Do you like hardships then be like me and buy this expensive game that will cause you to lose sleep!
It's a masterpiece. It'll make you a better gamer.   10/10
Elden Ring is the only good video game ever made.
Masterpiece if you are willing to learn controls and proper builds. Exploration is fun
FERMSOFT TAKING HOME WWWWWW's !!!!!!!!!
If I got to lose my memory of one game and re-play it for the first time, it'd be this game.

An actual game and not a loot box peddler. Incredible detail in lore, graphics, and overall content. Be prepared to die rather often though.  But its worth the effort, the Lands Between feels truly alive.
Meh, just not my style I guess.  I've tried to give it a chance multiple times and I just can't get into it.
I beat Malenia first try 
Elden Ring, GOTY for a reason. This game has an amazing story and excellent characters if you pay attention great gameplay and so many builds to tryout. I can't recommend this enough. After 100% the game I truly feel like my time in the Lands Between were amazing and hope if you decide to visit as well, be prepared for a long stay.
10/10
One word. Nut. 
Just play it...
As the first souls like game i have played, Elden Ring has blown my mind. From the huge variation in weapons and play styles, to some of the coolest boss fights and lore I've ever encountered, to the amazing art style, design, and scale of the world, Elden Ring is definitely a 10/10 game and i wholeheartedly recommend it
This game  made me buy a Ranii plush for 20$ just because i love the characters so much... there may be an issue with me spending any more time here
dark souls 2 is better
You do one bad thing and ur entire playthrough is ruined!!!!! SHIT GAME 7/10
literally nothing to do in this game smallest open world only has one boss and I cant even kill it FU soldier of godrick
good
Ill keep it short and simple. By far one of the best games made in last few years.
*Chefs kiss
WORTH EVERY $1 
okay this is a very beautifully made adventure. its not for the weak of heart, It will test your limits from the beginning. Good luck and get lost in the adventure.
Bad at life? Instead of getting good at life just get good at this game instead. Both are equally hard but what would you rather do, have a life or have a big sword and murder mutants?
Try finger, butthole
*dies*
swag game
Game of the Year.
pretty butterfly lady is hard to beat, but still a very good game 
Honestly, way too much running / open world travel.
just play it. is good
Very fun and well made game
 10/10 nothing more
SHIT GAME
its pretty gud
I still have a little bit of a problem with infrequent crashes and frame rate drops, but the game keeps me coming back to play more.
Got obsessed with this game and now I am maidenless
Great but now that i've beaten the campaign i feel like nothing is left. Pvp doesn't interest me as much. If they had procedural dungeons or something like that it would be endlessly entertaining.
This game deserves GOTY and every penny of it. Not my first Souls game but my first one to be having all achievements completed. Highly recommended. Your first play through will be none like others.
no don't fell like writing so its good
amazing
Does another game exist?
I will start off with, the game is fun and it is worth playing if you are new to the Souls series, or you suck at the Dark Souls games.. but... I don't get it.Id rather go back and play Dark Souls 3 personally..   I have easily several Hundred hours in DS1. well over 2000 in DS2 and at least the same amount in DS3. I don't get it.  Elden Ring is not that great. After nearly 200h I can confidently say, Dark Souls was Better. The game is clearly made for Casuals, and the combat is kind of Braindead easy when you aren't being cheap shotted by a Boss with a mechanic that is unavoidable. Like, a lot of enemies will attack you as you are recovering from a Knockdown, hitting you BEFORE the animation even ends of you standing up, making you unable to avoid it. and that is the only thing you need to learn.. once you learn how to avoid the cheap shots.. the game becomes trivial.  In the Souls Series, there were virtually no Cheap shots.. this game is littered with them, giving it Artificial difficulty. These things make it Seam difficult, but its really not. 9/10 Bosses in this game I can literally just sit there and Charged-Heavy the Boss to death with Caesti, no need to Dodge or avoid at all. Even with my Insane Regen build in past games, I never could do this. I get up to over 1000 AR with FISTS. FISTS! I can get a Guaranteed 3 hit combo off on another Player that deals a total of 3k damage, before Defenses.. even after defenses, most people are Dead after that...   they Ruined Poise. While it is nice to have DS 1 and 2 Passive Poise back, even at Max Poise you can only survie 2 swings from a Longsword or equivalent. Anything Bigger still 1 tap staggers.   If you just spec for Jumping Attacks, congrats! you beat the game.  The Open World is nice, but it really  doesn't offer much after the 1st playthrough.  in the 1st Play through, the open world is fun and exciting. in the NG+x Playthroughs, its tedious and actually annoying to have to constantly navigate.  80% of this game is not mandatory to get to the next playthrough, as opposed to the Souls games, where it was the exact opposite. It is an interesting take, but since 80% of the game is just useless past the 1st playthrough, whats the point? You will get through NG+ in like 30 mins.. Its really not all that.  The Ashes of War system is amazing and opens a lot of Options. Maybe in the future we get another game that gives us the option for actual Skills instead.   If you don't want to go Punch enemies for 1k damage at level 70 and up, just go mage... you can nuke anything from Players to Bosses as a mage and they cannot do anything about it.   Dont get me wrong, the Game is fun.. its just nowhere near as good as any of the People here want you to believe.  there are Detrimental bugs that will piss you off in PvP, like a Bug to increase Rivers of Bloods Phantom reach by like 100x. And its damage doubles as well.  Considerable amount of hackers are also still existing in the game.    all in all, this is a perfect game for the Dark Souls Novice, and the Casuals that don't feel ready to enter the Tryhard community of the actual Souls games.  but be prepared to know that most people are actually rather casual in this game, especially in PvP.. even in the Arenas, most ppl seem rather casual :/ RIP Dark Souls PvP standards
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
This is the first steam review i've written i think but wow. This game checks all the boxes. Incredible story, super amazing world, amazing combat, amazing weapons, so much to do. So many builds all viable. I beat the game only using a colossal sword i found in the first area. Gonna switch to magic on new game+ play through, everybody should play this game. Literally best game of all time, just beat final boss almost 80 hours in.
me be elden lord W
this game sucks, buy it
A real game! (Instead of a predatory marketing micro transaction mess)
sex in a bottle 
yes
Geat game, Graphics are wild, Huge Map, would recommend!
This was my first Souls game. I beat it on my PS5, but loved it so much that I bought it again on PC. Since then, I’ve gone and beaten the other Soulsborne games. Elden Ring is like the greatest hits for the entire franchise. Definitely recommend it. Rise Tarnished!
IS NICE
As of 2023, this is the greatest game I have ever known.  It's not perfect, but it cannot be compared to any other.   On every play through I find more areas and items that I had not found previously.  Even after 400 hours, I still find massive areas and fierce bosses that guard unknown treasure.  The graphics are beautiful, the sound design is top notch, and the controls are tight. I would recommend using a wired controller, because you will notice even the slightest input lag.    This game will punish insanity.  But, if you are able to refine your tactics you will feel a sense of accomplishment from victory that is unparalleled.  Sure you will get frustrated.  There will be times it feels unfair.  But there is always another approach to any situation.  I would not say that Elden Ring is "Hard" but survival does require your full attention at all times.    It is absolutely worth every penny.  Elden Ring has ruined every other RPG for me.  It is Pandora's box.    Beware, this game will destroy your life.  It will become an obsession.  And you will never be the same. 
Love this game DLC needs to come out
10/10
I DIED. 11/10 would play again.
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. 
Makes me kadghjs adghjs adghjs adghjs adghjs adghjs asdghj asdghj asdghj asdghj asdghj adghjs adghjs adghjs adghjs adghjs
Its punishingly difficuly, but stunning to explore and be educated in the lore... fear not...
Plenty reviews saying why
frustrating and refreshing at times. that's the fun of it. Conquering the enemy and getting progressively better
fuck the Godskin noble
They hurt me
Bing bong stab the people and do awesome to have fun. It's souls, so you know what it is.
AMAZING GAME WITH GREAT REPLAYABILITY
In Tetris, players must arrange falling shapes called tetrominoes in a way that creates horizontal lines without any gaps. As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster and the player must think and move quickly in order to keep up. One of the great things about Tetris is that it is very easy to learn, but difficult to master. This means that players of all skill levels can enjoy the game, but there is always room for improvement and challenges for those who want to push themselves. Tetris is also a very social game, with many different variations available on Steam that allow players to compete against each other online, either cooperatively or in head-to-head matches. These variations can add an extra layer of fun and challenge to the game, as players must compete against others to see who can score the highest.
fucking hate it
The best game of ever. So sad I had to finish it :( Please play, souls fan or not
I think I might be a masochist
ngl i still much prefer Dark Souls 1, but i guess this is an alright game
Forefathers one and all, BEAR WITNESS!
Dark Souls 4: Prepare to be bored edition
👍
One of the best games I've ever played.
My 2nd  Soul Game. Buy It no Regrets At all
Открытый в мир в конце душит, но остальное заебись!
WingsOfRedemption Ignores His Crying Wife For Dark Souls DISASTER Stream!  "whatever"
the game looks cool !
Bonk for the win
elden ring
very easy
A perfect continuation of FromSoft's expansion and refinement of their iconic gameplay, adding crafting, an open world, and a nonlinear progression to the mix, which works incredibly well. A saga of an experience each player's own, this game has pretty much anything any fan of action rpgs could want, though I wish I could make more than 10 characters. I'm almost through my second playthrough and it still feels like there's so much I haven't seen. Like Cyberpunk 2077 a concept brought to beautiful life.
Its like an MMO, but alone, unless you don't want to be,
This game makes me want to tear my own arms off
its a great game you will get very angry playing it tho but the bosses are awsome and the game has a great open world i would recomend getting it
Head
try finger but hole?
One of the best SoulsBorne games out there. Is far more forgiving than the others, but still has a good difficulty curve... until you get to the end. Just remember... The dopamine hit for beating Melania is worth the 40+ hours to beat her your first time.
great fucking game. 
it is a fun game
TO EZ
Dumb ways to die.... so many dumb ways to die.....
GREAT GAME GOOD
I think it goes without saying that this game does come with a learning curve however, should you take the time to actually learn from your mistakes, test out new weapons, spells etc. then this game will reward you for your efforts. These games have rose in popularity for a good reason. It will make you actually feel like your on some epic adventure. No mindless quests, no fetch and go BS. Breathtaking artwork and architecture inspired by actual places. One of a kind game. Recommend for people looking to Co-op or anyone strictly looking for a fantastic single player experience. (co-opers be warned... fight with honor or have your corpse defiled. Tarnished like the rest of us)
fucking masterpiece
TOP.
but. I. can't. stop,  Send help
l
it's called a souls game because that's exactly what you trade in order to play.
Geci jo
It's the one of the hardest yet most accessible of the big ones from Fromsoft.  If you haven't played a Soulsemup before I legit suggest you start with this one.  Plays smooth, looks nice, has waifus and husbandos for all, worth full price.
Amazing experience, stunning graphics and visuals. Perfection.
Many build options, much enjoy!
yeas
elde mn ring
I took 1 week of vacation to play this game 16 hours a day non stop for 7 days.  100% worth it.  A masterpiece by FromSoft.
Playing this game is like willingly giving yourself AIDs
Network Status Check Failed 
Game of the year! Open World Soul game with a brilliant art style! Action packed and hard to crack as usual, there are more variants on how to beat the well-designed bosses.
Pretty boring and poorly designed game, also doesn't even have ray tracing.
nice
Fun
just a great game. play it :)
get Gud. its easy to do in this one.
Just great.
iz cool fam play it!
john elden ring
I feel bad for controllers when playing this game..... sometimes I wonder how many get smashed around the world when people play souls-like games. 10/10 Would smash controller to play again!!!
i still need someone to explain to me how people say malenia is hard but no one talks about astel. 
The rage i felt playing this game was enough to literally make me sweat from anger. Ive broken 2 controllers. I love this game. It is fantastic just to look around let alone the amazing and insane fights. Truly Beautiful in the most painful ways. F*** THOSE CATACOMBS IMPS
first off, tree.
this game is incredible and as someone who loves the souls games its a must play
bets selling dark souls game ever and i hate it
Over 1000 hours played over multiple platforms, and still in love. Must buy!
I don't like the souls games, BUT Elden Ring might be the best game I ever played.
no pokemo
i finally beat the game
superb
I genuinely think this is the best game ever made.  Fromsoft always finds some way to innovate on their best titles, every release is a culmination of whats learned in the past. And Elden Ring is simply perfect, it was perfect on launch, and it will live forever being perfect. Those who have never played a souls game owe it to themselves to play Elden Ring.
I really don't understand the hype.  I was a huge fan of Bloodborne, so I was excited to give this one a shot, but  it just isn't for me.  The almost complete lack of direction leaves me pretty bored.
A M A Z I N G ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED
maidens
soyface
Tarnish find a girl boss!
Well deserved Game of the Year 2022! I had 120 Hours of pure excitement from just one Walkthrough. And immediatly after completing the first one I started a new one with another Class. It is super rare for me to play a game twice back to back, but this game just managed to catch me!
Phenomenal game that gets even better when you use the Seamless Co-op mod. Makes for a fun experience regardless of skill level in games. Don't be scared to give it a whirl, I believe in you, Tarnished.
astrologist moment
Amazing!  My first souls game, and i'm really enjoying it so far! 6 hours in and i only just beat Margit. Highly recommended!
what if open world game but good
Good stuff;  - interesting story - lots of challenge; seriously git gud or get out (i learned this the hard way). When you meet something new just run.  - You will die a lot but dont get frustrated but take it as a journey, as some youtube guide said.  - the views and details are just beatiful - atmosphere really beatiful - some cutscenes (of the very few that there are) are really astonishing.  - first i was gonna put this in the bad stuff but; no quest directions, you need to figure out everything by youself. but then again it makes this more interesting even if it causes frustration.  Bad stuff - the story itself is interesting but it's shallow and there is no great immersion with it. Missing storytelling/cutscenes/etc.. Expected way more. - lots of repetetive dungeons - grinding (well this is sorta acceptable) - XBOX-world. whole thing is planned for consoles and not pc. causes irritation with controls and movement. - Weapon modifications are booring as hell. Just level them up, nothing more. difficult to change what you have trained so you are gonna stick with the same type of dude even on the ng+1.
Amazing!
Cinematic masterpiece. Truly breathtaking world/level design with mesmerizing views everywhere.  Story is beautiful and leads to massive levels of immersion.  10/10 one of the games of all time.
I ... ugh.... I need to touch grass
It's alright
I think this game lived up to its hype. It's kind of unique in that it's an open world souls game, which really lets you choose your own path. There's tons of lore if you want it to be more of a story game, and there's a ton of really strong enemies if you prefer a more hack-and-slash adventure. You can choose from many different builds, my favorite of which would be a dexterity build. This game, at least for your first run through it, will keep you occupied a while. The game itself is beautiful as well.
I like it
try fingers, but hole
It is not a good game. It looks amazing and the environments are cool, but it is not a good game.
About the same quality as skyrim, but in all the different ways.
cool
astonishing game
This game is an adventure worth having.
Playing This game is like having Satan kick you in the ball repeatedly 10/10 Would recommend
Must play.
It is a FromSoft Souls game nuff said
The only game i was nervous to play.
i cant beat radagon. game bad
Very fun especially with mods
Easily the most accessible soulsbourne game. Easy to learn and has a relatively smooth difficulty curve. Lots of different ways to play from the outset
Please kill me again.
fort, night.
Incredible game with so much exploration! great fights and challenges! Feels rewarding killing anything and thats just in the first zone!
FromSoftware made a game that slaps harder then my dad's belt. First of all, the game is actually in a finished state. Meaning no Wild Hearts, 2042, Cyberpunk BS with lots of bugs and lack of stability. The game has no Micro-transactions, no need to have internet to play a single player game (although there is co-op and invasions), no quest hand holding, meaning you actually have to actually explore.
very good game, kinda hard at first but stick at it and you'll improve
Good Game
Finished my first playthrough at about 80hrs, in those 80 hours I experienced so many beautiful landscapes, interacted with cool NPC side quest characters, fought dragons and demigods, died countless times and kept coming back for more. Overall this game feels and plays like a souls game, movement is great, the addition of a jump feature was something past souls games didn't have but thank god its here now. Horseback riding to traverse the MASSIVE landscape that is the map of Elden ring, with only 80hours I know I didn't get to doeverything but with my second and third playthrough already planned We'll reach 100% achievements here soon. Overall 10/10 from me
U can kill an npc that called u "Maidenless"
good
It's interesting enough for me to play the game 1.5x and unlock all Steam achievements. I liked the challenging gameplay and how beautiful the setting (environment + lore) was but that's probably where it ends. There's barely any story, no interesting side quests, or any character development.  Apparently, it's a runner up for Best Narrative runner up though and that's how FromSoft makes their games. The don't spoon feed round and dynamic characters with compelling stories. They like to scatter bits and pieces of lore that happened a long time ago which the player character barely affects and call it a day.   Who wants to be spoon fed when you can eat soggy day old cereals from the floor anway?
I am tarnished
Fantastic game! <3
best game in the whole world and fuck everyone who says no
I put a hole in my desk, I love this game.
lost my save for playing for 40 hours  dint do anything
This game is amazing. In most games, you usually farm NPCs. In this game, the NPCs farm you!
one of the best games ive ever played would recommend
piece of art
Excellent Game, easy to navigate and fun to play
This game is too good to be described with words.
An outstanding experience and deserving goty. Definitely a good starting point for those not familiar with soulslike games. Except for a few enemies, the game felt well-balanced and fair. Anybody looking for a great rpg look no further.
open world poopy.................
If you like fantasy and RPG's this is an awesome game. Listed as a Dark Souls, but can be played either way.  There is a sad underlying tone to the game, but there are stories in it with Happier endings, there are so many different ways to play and build out your character, for me it's been a blast just making mistakes and finding out some of them actually work positively for my character in the game. Don't come in with too cynical an eye, because there is humor to be found here too. A very fun game you can play your way or you can play with friends (or strangers)... the multiplayer really adds an extra dimension of fun!
made me wanna die  10/10
Hate this trash a$$ game
Before this game, the only From Software game I had played was Sekiro. So I came into the game expecting something similar, just with a new backdrop. I don't know how they fucked it up, but this is leaps and bounds worse of an experience. Compared to its contemporaries, the combat is slow and unintuitive. There's a lot of fucking around with your build and other RPG elements (which is fine if that's what you're looking for). Coming from the simplicity of the Sekiro combat system, it is a lot to take in.  There are blatant levels of polish that have not been applied here. Weapon textures clip on your back, the platforming is abysmal (though sparse), there is no pause feature, you can't see the enemy's stance meter for some reason, and other little details that add up. The one small thing that peeves me the most is the lack of an indication that you're going to backstab someone. In Sekiro this big red icon comes up that tells you "hello this is going to be a one hit kill," but in elden ring I got to give the guy a rimjob because I don't want to accidentally hit him with a light attack.  I do enjoy how the open world is handled, every time you get to a checkpoint it points a big arrow in the direction it wants you to go in so you're not fucking around lost all over the place. It takes the best of both worlds in that way (being linear and open world storytelling). For what I have experienced, the story seems genuinely intriguing, I just with I could experience it rather than crawling through this castle. I could not bring myself to finish this, just not the kind of game I like.
I still have no clue what I'm doing
I think fire ring is a bad spell. after you can't can't choose how hard it should be. And it doesn't tell you what to go, and it just doesn't make the game fun, and that it's hard. and it is expensive.
Fantastic game that is rich in story, content and challenge.
best game
highly recommended insane graphics and runs incredibly well on linux. If vanilla game is too hard I highly recommend playing coop.
Elden Ring players when Elden Bling gets released.
Very good game. Only issue is that it does not have ultra-wide support, let alone my super ultra-wide monitor. The game remains in 16:9 with black borders on the sides. A variable frame rate would have been nice too, but I read that the game is intended to be on 60fps, so I can live with that.  As for the Steam Deck, it runs great on Medium settings preset with FSR on in the Deck's overlay. My playtime before 0% is around 1hr to 1hr 30min.
hard game but very fun. wish i could pause though
One of the best souls-likes I ever played
This is what GOTY should look like :3
this game is amazing has alot of great content would very highly sugges you play it!
My PP still harder than the game
It's Elden Ring
this game practices a non consensual sex on you
Very nays game
Amazing game, all though i some how gained 150lbs from playing only a few days
sangat rekomended untuk menghilangkan stress                            "11/10"
it is very cool gaem but hard it is
After having played for over one hundred hours, I believe that this is my favorite game FromSoft has ever released. My first playthrough took sixty(!) whole hours to complete, so the game obviously has a plethora of content to enjoy. As with every other dark souls game, there is an immense amount of fun builds that you can choose from to suit every player's desired style. This make it all the more fun to challenge the game's difficulty. Difficulty in this game is set up in a way that makes it easier or harder depending on however the player decides to prepare themselves for something, due to the open world nature of Elden Ring. This makes it, in my opinion, the easiest game FromSoft has created to get into for a new player. I would recommend this game to anybody who does enjoy a challenge and loves open world games when they're actually made with love rather than by EA. Much love if you get this game <3
Insane
Game had a lot of hype it came out i finished it and enjoyed it then that was that.   The previous souls series kept you coming back this game not so much. 
immersive and challenging plus visually stunning
If i could replay this game for the first time i would.
Dog ahead
"Body type A" and "Body type B"
DO YOU PREFER SOULS-LIKE GAMES BE OPEN WORLD OR NOT ?  for me all dark souls is better than elden ring just because that reason!
Summons are for kids and noobs
After 61 hours I finally finished creating the character, it's time to play 
10/10
cool game
Little too easy for me
This game is one of the greatest games I've ever played, but probably also the one that made me hate my life the most, at certain times. Have fun !!!
Suffering ahead
Truly Fantastic =D
like a huge praline
this game sucks, i keep dieing
i love elden ring

You Died
A modern gaming masterpiece. Elden ring is a culmination of over a decade of game design by Fromsoftware. An intriguing open world ? Check Amazing combat ? Check Diverse enemy types ? Check Diverse builds ? Check Frustrating gimmicks in fights ? (looking at you Mohg) Check A ton of lore, but no exposition ? Check.  Overall, this game is an instant classic. And is meant to be played along with some helpful lookups. The game is designed with the community in mind, and you can see it with the integration of player messages in the game.  Play it for the gameplay, stay for the Vaati's lore videos. Don't bother with PvP, there are always tryhards with dual naginata's poking you from a mile away, and from barely does enough to balance that.  The most accessible souls title. You can completely trivialise the difficulty of this game, or roleplay a character, who is going to have a tough time.   Arise Tarnished. 
average graphi9cs but a nice game world 
The most accessible souls game to date. OFC there is no easy mode, but that can be solved to going to an easier area and farming runes. I avoided anything with the label souls-like. But after experiencing what Elden Ring had to offer, im def more interested as the genre as awhole
Pros:  -Incredible Graphics (Like seriously man, this game is like a movie) -Incredible Weapons and Builds (speaks for itself) -Sick bosses and enemies -Well designed areas, love Limgrave and Caelid and Lurnia of the Lakes is a slight big below both of them but so far I love them all. -Super Satisfying  Cons: -Some supper annoying bugs such as the stuttering that still occurs a full year after release which is just embarrassing, can really get on my nerves because it always happens at the worst times.  -They should make multiplayer easier (not because I'm bad but because it would just be nicer to have that way, but I've seen opposing opinions saying it ruins the "souls-like" part of it but come on man its annoying to have to have a limited number of summons to do things) -This game is so good it makes me hate other games that aren't a similar god-like level  Easy 10/10 could not recommend more. As someone who started out playing this game clueless on the souls-like genre it became a lot more fun when instead of cluelessly mucking about I got some help from people/internet to find out what I was doing. Don't be afraid to do things like that if it helps you enjoy the game more.
For souls fans: It's a mish-mash of the other soulsborne's all smashed together with some awesome new things as well.   For those new to the series: It's a big open world that is very challenging. If you are stubborn/ prideful, you will probably be frustrated. Don't bang your head against the wall. You're supposed to go other places and level up a little.
Game called me maidless. I want to prove them wrong.
This is the video game of video games. Like when you think of a video game this is what you think of. This is the Video Game of legend.
a masterpiece
mastahpieece baby
A work of art. I foresee that even 1000 years from now, people will still talk about and celebrate this game

It's challenging, but it's so customizable that you keep coming back. Even more fun with friends.
GOAT
THE BEST
The only game I've played where you have to play the "optional" content to have any hope of beating the main questline.
fantastic. really fun way of spicing up the dark souls combat by throwing in some sekrio and bloodborne elements.
I don't really have much substantive to say on Elden Ring that you can't find a million other places. What I can say is I had a really good time with it, much more than any of the Souls games I've tried before, and even though I got pretty burned out on it I still think it's absolutely worth playing. It just eventually got to the point where progressing further in any direction felt like running into a wall, so I decided to drop it, but that happened well over 50 hours in so I can't really complain too much.
Pain never felt so good.
THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its 2023 and still no ultrawide support.
Just buy it already
The game is a thing of beauty, nough said.
"Try finger, but hole..."
Game good, Mods Good, Fun/10
Very big. Very difficult. Very rewarding.
This is the most amazing game I have ever played. Can't wait for the DLC
126 hours went by fast. Anyways, not my type of game but it was still fun. Every turn/path leads to something interesting. I found myself saying "one more dungeon/cave/ruin several times and spending hours going through it.
fun 
Just endless ways to explore this world. 
Touch grass... become badass.
Beautiful world. Crazy weird but beautiful. Replayable if you like many characters or you can just respec and do another play through with the same character. I don't think I've had this much fun making different builds ever, I mean ever, and I'm like old compared to you. Ok, unless you're one of the 42 year old dudes who reconnected with his son by playing this game.
89 hours in. the game got fun
Fantastic game, really presents a spectacle, 100%ed. The views, effects, and creatures are all gorgeous (or delightfully hideous); fights are well designed and varied, with acceptable repeats for a game this size; and the soundtrack is amazing, all of it. Not for the leisure gamer, though.   My only critique would be the last 20% or so of the game, where boss health can go a bit overboard and some of them break the rules of the game (the biggest offender is Malenia, who has some design choices I really question). Solid 9/10.
Do I even have to say why this game is good? Just buy it!
hard as hell but once you get it, you get it (plus i still got no idea what to or to not upgrade)
EPIC
I mean it's a great game, but it is also not a perfect game. it has some slight things that bug me. One of which is the aggressive early bosses, and by aggressive i mean nonstop dodge fights. As someone else also pointed out, the really huge world leads to a more convoluted path trough the world The upgrade system slaps, the visuals are great. If you feel like getting lost in a world for days on end, this game is for you. if you want a more linear experience, it's a bit more muddy because this world encourages exploration but then punish you with bosses when you get there, or you could say reward you with them, depending on your viewpoint.  8 to 9 ish out of 10.  Def a game you should play, if you have ever liked souls games.
Maidens Acquired
ye0p vgood
If you bad don't play.
i would recommend this game. awesome open world, graphics, and difficultly make it really fun. you can customize your class however you want and conquer Elden Ring
Amazing game. I Love the fact there is no micro transactions and that is hours and hours of game play even in new game +. I cant wait for the DLC!
This has got to be one of the best games ever made. I know I only have about 86 hours on this game currently, but let me tell you, this is next level in the gaming industry. I've never been so hooked to an open-world so badly and I've only got 86 hours of gameplay. This game will have you addicted in seconds due to the enormous amount of quests, weapons, exploration, and bosses. Please, if you're thinking of buying this, BUY IT!
Very good
Very Hard, Very Nice
Amazing
This game makes you want to bang your head against a concrete staue of dadas 12 guage but also its a good environment at least
This game is an absolute masterpiece. As someone who wasn't a fan of the Dark Souls series, I was initially hesitant about pulling the trigger on Elden Ring, especially at full price. Needless to say the game has assuaged all my concerns, and I can easily see myself spending another 70 to 90 hours playing. In fact, I am so ecstatic about my purchase that I feel like I've scammed FromSoftware by only paying $59.99.
good game

habubdububeubdubd
40 hours in, still maidenless
Realy fun 10/10
after beating the game 3 times and 103 hours i can truely say im addicted to it
good game
I liked that I can explore and it actually rewards me for it with better gear or something to get better gear or stats with. I also like how the bosses are an actual challenge that you have to get better gear for.
Biggest mistake was leaving this game in my library untouched for 6 months.  That could of been 6 months of non-stop gaming.  11/10
worth it I would give 10/10 but I am not maidenless so 9.9/10
After 220 hours I can say that I have killed every boss gotten every grace and every weapon and almost every armor set with all achievements completed. While I can’t show you my first time playing this game I can describe it to you. It Began with a beautiful customizable character being able to choose your class and your keepsake I decide to choose wretched and no keepsake as I didn’t fully understand what that was yet. A beautiful opening making me feel excited to get into gameplay. I spawn in a church wondering what I should do next taking my time until I find the item needed. Making my way out of the church I quickly run into the first boss shaking with excitement not knowing how to attack even roll I quickly died. Waking up in a cave I run to a double door and open it seeing a grace waiting for me just past. Finally making my way up on the elevator opening the gate to see the vast world of the Lands Between. Quickly being insulted by an NPC saying that Im maidenless I assault him I lose over and over again until I finally kill him. Feeling accomplished I run over to the first church and run into the Tree Sentinel. Words can’t describe how many times I have tried to kill that boss and failed. I feel as if every input I made was not my choice but as if it was his choice that I was going to do a jumping heavy and positioned himself perfectly to not only dodge my attack but get two attacks on me. Try and try again, I said to myself, not knowing that this would be the hardest boss I would ever fight. After all the attempts at killing the tree sentinel, I felt demolished I couldn’t find the motivation to continue playing I say I only played 5 or 10 minutes of exploring the west side of Limgrave before I stopped playing.
One of the most rage inducing games ive ever played but once you get the hang of it then its pretty fun.
Is dun gud game, very much a torturous journey 
i hate this game with every fiber of my being and wish nothing but the worse on all who were involved in the creation of this game, highly recommend a solid 9/10
im an older player and really am enjoying the challenges in this game.. what a great feeling to finally beat that boss or find something cool you didn't know you were looking for... lots of online help out there too...so much like ds3 but even better... if you like a challenge.. this is the game.. play it your way... its a blast 
Yes Its good game very nice   
Pretty good game only downside is that you can't have sex with the maiden
When you understand the game, when you "click" with it, it will be one of the best experiences you ever had, i promisse :)
Masterpiece. An open world souslike. Beautiful environments, lots of secrets, exploration, challenges, weapons and items. You can go magic if you want easy mode.   Locked 60 FPS is a crime, but fortunately there's a mod to unlock it.
By far the best FromSoftware game ever released, the open world aspect gives you an immersive experience accompanied by its wonderful written storyline/lore. Everything you need is in here, come and join this beautiful world.
Absolutely phenomenal game. Completely deserved game of the year 2022. It is obviously a fromsoft game so its hard as fuck but that weirdly doesn't take away the fun. Everything about this game is a 10/10, recommend to everyone
its good
game
Awesome open world game. There's a reason it won 2022 game of the year. Don't sleep on this game!
If you suck and its not fun push through it i did that for cuphead and it is so much more fun now 
if your a masochists you will love it.

Deserving of every award received. 10/10.
Zeldas breath of the wild but make it harder and most things look nasty
cool game
Game is based on skill not sash and grab
Somehow managed to be both the hardest, and most approachable souls-like experience.
No maidens?
you should already know if your considering buying this game
Correct! the circle goes in the square hole!
Played the Game, but still Maidenless :(
Melania is hot 10/10
This game makes me want to blow my brains out and have it splatter across the wall... in a good way 10/10
Best Game In a while
Department of Motor Vehicles: The Game  After having to pay way too much just to be there, you're treated to a lengthy, boring wait. Although it's dull as fuck, you try to occupy yourself by looking around the room for anything remotely attention-keeping. Time eventually drips by, and you finally find yourself called to take the written test.  You happen to be pretty familiar with traffic laws, but some of the questions aren't even in English. That's too fucking bad, it's not there to hold your hand. Since making more than three mistakes will result in you failing, you find yourself having to bare all the boredom and dreariness of the wait, over and over again.  Hopefully you git gud at driving enough to memorize all of your wrong choices thus far, and by sheer will and refusal to move on, finally pass the written test. You will, at this point, have access to the next uneventful wait; The road test...with a tractor. The process will repeat itself ad infinium until it simply cannot be failed.  Finally, after X number of loops through hell, you can finally walk away victorious, having outlasted the DMV and all its bullshit.  And don't expect your driver's license. Passing the test was reward enough, right?
I absolutely love this game! I have played for a little over 80 hours and I must say that this is the greatest game I've ever played. I love the story especially the bosses. I really like that this game is open world so you if its a little hard for you, you can always go pick up some strong items, farm some levels then return to the boss or section of map that you had trouble with. Allthough it might be a little hard at the start don't worry it you can get good real fast at this game.   Overall I highly recomend this game. Its definetely 10/10 game for me
is fun
It's amazing
Playing this game with online enabled is a form of self harm
I recommend the game if you want to suffer!
Good
Game of the year
Legendary, top 10 games off all time.
simply the best game
fuck all of them i'm a really big fan of astels "you are now dead" attack really i cant emphasize this enough Fuck. all. of. them. all the bosses im looking at you melenia and your stupid ass water dance also the fuck is up with the story i have no idea whats going on i had to look at 3 videos to explain it to me 10/10 wholehardedly reccomend
The game is awesome, i love how difficult it is. It's my first souls like game and it is indeed a masterpiece. I always visualize myself as surviving adventurer in a hostile world while playing it. Kinda like a "Isekai" narrative but without maidens XD
coool
Finally decided to try a souls game after this one won all the awards. Thought it might have included better support for people with learning disabilities. But nope, it just screws with you. If there was a simpler boss mode option I would give this game a 10/10 for being a good open world rpg. But it lacks options for us mentally disabled folks. so 0/10
Pain
THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOO DAMN GOOOD!
Totally beautiful, mysterious and often confusing (especially trying to do what are basic functional hotkey actions on M&KB, such as equip pouch items and feed the horse), Elden Ring is endlessly entertaining and frustrating. I wish the devs had taken more time with the port to PC, but all in all, a remarkable accomplishment.
ballin'
Pretty chill
worth to buy at full price , fuck i bought it twice ahahhaha , amazing game
was fun beat game in 29 :)
good game 
great game i suggest to get all achievements for the best experience
i need to touch grass

great
besat
just beat the game and brought an age of stars. the euphoria i felt cannot be described and beating this game will always be better than the touch of a woman. no one can tell me otherwise. eating mac n cheese right now. i know my happiness will only go down form here. this is the highlight of my life
its hard but worth it. Amazing game but it lacks guidance, but guidance is out there to be found. At the very least, it's worth searching for which areas to explore first.
So, before I even begin, let me clarify some stuff  I tried Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3, and hated all of them. I don't mean they're bad games, I definitely agree they're among the greatest series of all time and are an example to follow in terms of philosophy. But the gameplay is just not for me.  I played Sekiro, almost reached the end but eventually dropped out long enough for me to become too rusty to actually finish it. But I enjoyed it a lot!   So, what about Elden Ring? Well, just have a look at my hours on record and check the achievements on my steam profile. You'll see that I have... quite a different opinion !  To make it simple:  [h1] YOU. CAN. BEAT. IT. [/h1]  It is hard. Oh god is it hard. 188 hours of struggle and difficulty. But damn did I enjoy every single one of them.  Overall, it's your typical dark souls gameplay and experienced, but streamlined, improved and with a more intense and dynamic approach. Your moveset has so much more variety, and weapons are all so diverse (and every weapon type is viable!) that you will definitely find a playstyle that will suit you (mine was two greatswords, jump attack spam and I loved it).  But the main thing that made a huge difference for me was the open world. Not because I like open worlds in particular, but because that meant if a boss was too hard for me I could just leave and come back later with better gear and a higher level.  Just trust me, it's the most accessible Soulsborne game you'll find. it's actually great.

I would like to play this game with my reformed orthodox rabbi bill clinton .
Stuck in Margit, please help
why pc port so bad
FUCK! THIS! GAME! My doctor almost perscribed me a stronger blood preasure medication, because my evening readings had went up over the past month. But I explained that I've started playing Elden Ring before bed around a month ago.  I'm relieved that I killed the Elden Beast and can leave this threat to my health behind.  8/10 - needs but wholes
First and foremost, Elden Ring lives up to the hype. The world is expansive and breathtaking, filled with secrets to uncover and enemies to defeat. The combat system is fluid and satisfying, with a range of weapons and abilities to master. But what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its sense of discovery. Every corner of the world feels alive with potential, and every encounter feels like a new challenge to overcome.  But beyond its gameplay, Elden Ring tells a compelling and deeply philosophical story about the nature of power, ambition, and the consequences of our actions. It's a game that rewards patience and reflection, asking players to consider their choices and the impact they have on the world around them.  Overall, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest games of all time. If you're a fan of challenging action RPGs, rich world-building, and thought-provoking storytelling, then this game is an absolute must-play. Don't miss out on the chance to experience this unforgettable adventure.

First souls game. There were many things I had to get used to at first. I typically like having a set path to follow but I have come to like how completely open and exploitative this game is. All of the bosses feel so good rewarding.

One of those game that Every gamer has to own. My first ever FromSoftware game and its just YES. Graphics are Amazing, super Immersive
I have been playing for 5 hours and I am still nowhere, this game is very challenging and winning will make you feel accomplished.
I usually never play story based games or non fps genres. This game has given me so much enjoyment and plenty of reasons to comeback and play, from the game play to the environment this game is a masterpiece. I 100% recommend this game to everyone, it's one of those games you just never forget.
best game ♥
Elden Scrolls is pretty good, assuming you dont mind extremely shitty duo bosses a myriad of spells and a boss that literally breaks the rules of the game.
you felt stronger every time you beat a boss.  and felt powerless 5 minute after.
Pra quem curte souls like, é uma experiencia muito legal poder ter um mundo aberto pra explorar. To adorando a gameplay e as novas mecanicas implementadas. Deu realmente um novo ar para o gênero.
Pretty gud

Amazing game, but please add support for ultrawide..
Best open world game I have ever played. There is so much to explore and do in every area, so many possibilities. Definitely one of the best games you will ever play if you are into these types of games. Only thing that is lacking in this game is the repeatability. Once you do everything and explore everything in the game. It just isn't fun to play the game over again which is really disappointing unlike Dark Souls. This shouldn't keep you away from buying it because to do everything it will take you more than 150 hours. Overall recommended to everyone who like challenging games.
there is a reason it got game of the year.

Man I'm gunna have to buy a new controller now aren't I

Awesome game... Just because of the Jump Button alone make me don't want to go back and play older Souls games again.
try finger but whole
There are things done RIGHT: The Open World is intruiging, Combat feels great, It runs fantastic, The World looks GORGEOUS, There are some areas inside the Open World that are legitimately INSANE, The Mobs, Bosses and NPCs are well desgined, The Sounddesign is good and weapons, attacks, etc all are fantastic  However this can't carry the negatives I found with this game:  Feeling Lost: I know it's a meme, but hear me out. I literally SKIPPED the tutorial by accident. I walk here: "oh the enemies are too hard, you need to go elsewhere" my friends tell me. Well so I did. I walk there: Now I'm oneshotting everything since I was MEANT to go there much earlier. That is no fun. How should I know which level of  "hard but fair" is acceptable? No idea.  I wanted to play this game blind, but I literally could not - I would've quit the game 5 hours into it if I had no friends to teach me. I frequently find myself asking: "can I fight this one?", "Am I supposed to be here?", or "How do I find X?"."Go find out for yourself!" say my friends. "The game tells you when you are not meant to be here", they say. This is where I don't agree: No guidence at all lets me feel lost, clueless, I had no idea on how to do basic things, sometimes I'm overlevelled, sometimes I'm underlevelled. Elden Ring, for the love of god, is HORRIBLE at communicating information to the player. I know you all are down to BASH hand-holding the player, but SOME guidence should be given. And NO, The questlines and storylines all don't make sense and are rather missleading, sometimes leading you to areas you most certainly shouldn't be, to be fully honest. Being Open World makes this problem 10x more apparent. Let's talk more about that.  Variety: Going Open-World has it's problems. I frequently find myself uninterested in the exact same Dungeons, Bosses, Boss-Rooms, Enemies. The entire copy-paste of some sections had me feeling disappointed. This hits much harder because I know they CAN do better. Some of the most breathtaking areas I've ever experienced are in this game. But you can't fully build the Open World on these areas, right? Well you just have to look at other Souls games to recognize that this is very possible. A lot of bosses also get reused or become normal Mobs - which apparently is normal? I'm not getting exited anymore when seeing (most) BOSSES. Think about that. Meta is also a big part of Variety. I personally have no idea about this stuff tbh, but I frequently heard about meta builds being broken or nessassary to defeat harder bosses, PVP-builds all being the same, etc. This hurts the integrity and one of the best aspects of the game: play however you want. Point proven: Elon Musk literally got flamed and people wrote articles about him for using an "off-meta" build. wtf? I'm HEAVILY discouraged of doing so, because X is most broken, ,Y is nessassary to beat stuff or, going to my next point, I levelled Z.  Limitation: Some limitation is very good and welcomed. However I REALLY dislike how weapons and Arts are Stat-Locked. How come I defeat the X-Dungeon or boss, wasting hard-earned Stone-Keys to play them, just to come out with a lackluster experience and a weapon I can't use? This feels genuinely HORRIBLE. Yes, I've been told I can respec, but 1) I have literally no idea how (feeling lost), and 2) I can do this only a limited amount of times. And no, I don't want to REPLAY the entirety of Elden Ring because, and this is the singular reason my friends replay this game, I want to try a new build. This seems INSANE to me.  It's unfair: Some Bosses and Mobs felt very unfun to play against (don't get me started about this invisible dude). I don't really want to waste 6 hours for the TUTORIAL BOSS. So what did my friends do? (this was one of the biggest mistakes I've done); we cheesed a Mob way beyond my league (but accessible for some reason; that doesn't make sense), giving me an INSANE amount of Levels. I've become overlevelled to the point where I still first-try bosses 40 hours into it. As a Newbie to Souls-Games. That doesn't feel right nor fun. Hearing that the lategame gets worse, with frequently more unfair enemies, I feel very discouraged to go on.  I came into Elden Ring and wanted a "Hard but Fair" game, but this couldn't be further from what I've experienced.   Story: I literally have no Idea why I play this game on a story-perspective. I know I want to be this Elden Lord, go to that Tree or whatever, but that's about it. The only reason I kept playing is because I want to find special places, see something I didn't see before. It comes down to everything feeling VERY confusing. I have this quest where I needed to go down a well to find some NPC. The Well-part was rather easy, but down there and without guidence by my friends I would've probably searched for a bit - then I found him and CAN'T EVEN PROCEED this questline. "The next part is out of my reach for some time" my friends tell me, seeing no problem with that.  Multiplayer: Multiplayer was a mistake. It's frequently laggy, It takes AGES to play together,  it's very limited and there are exploits that feel like straight up cheating. This shouldn't be the way you play this game imo. PVP is also very unfun, running into the same builds a lot of times ("YO It's another Guts-Build"- my friends shout in exitement). This is a personal point to be fair, but let it be mentioned here. This game is far better enjoyed in Single Player.   This is where I stand: I intentionally didn't go deep into the positives to prove my point but trust me: This game got GREAT things going for it. That's why I'll keep playing after all. It's far better than many Triple A titles (which is not hard to be fair). I first thought Souls-Games are just not my type of game, but I've disproven that by liking other souls-games I've played recently. I've truely thought I'm a noob, that the game is too hard because... well... I'm too bad. But that wasn't true aswell. I've finally stopped giving it the benefit of the doubt, "breaking my silence" one might say, and saw it for what is it: A great game with huge deal-breakers and impossible problems to solve. It's near impossible to play this game without any help, it lacks direction, multiplayer is bad, the story is a confusing mess, the Open World hurts the game more than it does good. This game is far from being the masterpiece people praise it to be.    To my friends: Tut mir Leid Alex und Christian, ich hab euch häufig getriggered, aber Elden Ring hat zu viele Probleme, welche mir den Spaß richtig oft rauben. :(
more a meme than man
100 hours played 50 percent of achievements done I love elden ring
I got f•cked hard
In 2 words - a masterpiece. Considering myself a casual gamer I ignored this game for so long and that was a huge mistake. The world is big and beautiful, for the first time in an open-world game I felt the true joy of adventure and discovery. I scout every corner not because there is some kind of quest reward or collectable, but because it's always something new and interesting. Battling is as difficult as you want it to be, I am yet to encounter a situation where I feel trapped in having to overcome some kind of an impossible challenge. Can't win for some time? Go do something else, level up, find new gear, improve your skill, then come back and have a fair fight. Considering there is always something new to do and discover - it never feels grindy. 
Arguably the best open world RPG i've ever played.
Onion Ring
***Before Malenia*** "Holy, how can this soul game so easy as tutorial?" ***After Malenia*** "This is a soul game, indeed."
The first 10 hours is like you reading into a new book. You start to understand what's this world is. Slowly and steady you will start to know this game. Resulting in loving this game. At first, I was scared whether it was worth my money or not cause I kept on dying and dying. But now after 10 hours of playing, it is worth it as hell. I LOVE THIS GAME
As a long time fan of Fromsoftware's modern output, Elden Ring has easily became my favorite next to Sekiro (though, you can't really compare these two). I'm not going really dwell on each aspect of the game as a whole, so I'm just going to say some helpful tips:  * PERFORMANCE Performance isn't really good, but it goes away after a while and by the time I went deeper into the game it was for the most part resolved. It does leave a bad first impression though sadly, and I'm generally disappointed at Fromsoftware for this, but in the end I kind of forgot about it since it really starts to go away after a while (it's classic shader stutter apparently). If this is really upsetting but you do want to keep playing, here are some tips: - Try going offline, it doesn't help much, but it's worth a shot - If you have enough memory, try setting shader cache to a higher value in your GPU setting After a while it's easy for the game to lock on 40-50 in the open world and 60 in dungeons on recommended specs, but I won't say that this is ideal, it's easily the weakest aspect of the game.  * GAMEPLAY TIPS If you are yet to play the game, here are my tips that I think can improve your experience (especially if this is your first Fromsoftware game):  - Pay absolutely no attention to the "Meta", meta is the enemy of fun. It's quite easy to build really high damage builds in this game, especially towards the end. Just pick up something that you like for early to mid-game. You do need to at least somewhat prioritize higher damage in the end-game though, but by that time, you'll probably have more than enough tools on your hand.  - There are quite a few multi-enemy bosses in the game. Don't treat them like O&S in Dark Souls, they were clearly never designed with the intention of you fighting them solo (which is a shame really). Summon a spirit, and if you do want to keep things "fair", remember that you can summon your spirit back by using the same item for summoning after the fight becomes one on one. Remember that spirits are an actual part of your build, rather than just some tools on the side. Once again, forget the meta, use whatever you like.  - Also on spirit summons, if you think that your summon is "stealing the fight" from you, there is talisman called "Shabriri's Woe" that you can get early game. Put that on, and the boss will prioritize you over your summon. It's surprising how well the summons can support you this way, while keeping you in control of the fight.  - Have multiple weapons with varying levels of upgrade. The game showers you with upgrade material just by clearing the major dungeons, and most of your damage comes from upgrade level instead of your stats. As long as you have the minimum stats and the correct infusion on the weapon, you'll have a pretty reliable weapon on hand. The reason that I suggest this is that it's quite easy to miss major areas and become over-leveled for those areas. Of course, the game has no problem with you destroying bosses, but if you do want a challenge, switch to a lower upgrade weapon, that'll be more than enough to level the field. Beyond that, it's just fun having multiple weapons to use in this game.  - Horse combat is almost completely optional to engage in. There are fights that I personally think are much more enjoyable with the horse, but there is no force on you to do that. If you do end up using the horse, I recommend you use a halberd or a long weapon. Short weapons just don't work on your horse if you are moving fast (at least I couldn't make them work).  - Don't sleep on the Ash of War system. Some of them are really useful. You can make entire playthroughs around some of these ashes (like the magical parry thingy ... or the one that restores your health when you hit someone). The infusion also means that you can use many weapon classes effectively. This is quite different from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, you really aren't bound to a class of weapons based on your build, and the game I will go as far to say, expects you to roleplay as different builds frequently.   - The crafting system isn't really that much in depth, but some of the consumables like Volcano Pots can completely melt some enemies; It's really funny. Give it a try once, if it doesn't interest you, then just forget it exists ...  - Invest at least a *bit* in Faith. Like maybe up to 12 or 15. Some incantations serve only defensive purposes, and are extremely useful in the end game, when the enemy damage becomes ridiculous. If not for that, just take a look at Lake of Rot ... you'll thank me later.  - On topic of defense, this is the first time I think your armor actually matters. Not only in the end game, but even as early as mid game, you can start getting chunked for like half your health quite easily if you are not careful. So either wear good armor, or use defensive talismans.  - There are a few "holes" on the map that the game gives you (like little brown circles ...), make sure you check them out. They are mines that usually always have bell bearings that you can trade in the hub for infinite supply of upgrade materials. Don't miss them.  Hope these help
I mean it's Elden Ring...Need anything else be said? From Software has time and again shown us that there are still awesome gaming companies out there, that don't half-ass things and deliver everything as promised.  Any true fan of the Dark Souls series will love and cherish this game.
no homeward bone :(
guzel
very ez gud
i learned 98 hours in you can sprint while crouched
Man, what a game.   This is my first introduction into the 'souls like' scene and I personally really enjoy this type of style.  Ever since I started playing Elden Ring, I always wanted to keep at it, even though I was getting absolutely flattened by everything, which is something incredibly rare.   Basically, in this game, you start out in this incredibly detailed open world where you play as a “Tarnished” of no renown, who is blessed by the guidance of grace, and your compelled to make the journey through The Lands Between and become "Elden Lord."  Elden Ring has a variety of boss battles (of course) that are uniquely hard and challenging in their own way, in other words, you never get bored. The sheer size of the map is incredible with separate underground areas, catacombs, caves tones of other stuff.   Elden Rings' game play is nothing like iv'e ever seen before and it's really awesome. I find that your always dealing with enemies who are stronger than you, introducing a high risk high reward concept.    Also, be prepared to open your browser because there's so much stuff that I found difficult and was confused about when playing this game, its just so complex. (Just for reference I've played this game for 190 hours and I still haven't explored everything.)   I have experienced a lot emotions while playing this game, one of them being anger, a lot of it. But when you finally defeat that boss that you needed to kill to progress, it is so rewarding and makes you feel really good about yourself.   In conclusion, Elden Ring is by far the best experience i've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. And simply put, the best game ever.  - 10/10
Immersive experience, would recommend not looking at any guides on your first play through
its rlly hard to learn but its a good game ;-;
Praise the message!  and then Try Elden Ring.
Okay, this is epic
I had to vote it down because Bandai decided to increase the prices of all their games in poor countries by 6 times.  Now, the games cost in my country more than a 10 days average wage. What a shame!!!
Gorgeous open world full of exciting and challenging enemies. Love the progression and the fighting mechanics as well.
one of the best games ever made!
very epic

Best Game I have Played so far
Very good game, albeit very difficult, especially for someone who hasn't ever played a dark souls game before. The only problem I have with the game is the horse physics, especially when on the side of a cliff. Dying to my horse doing a 180 and then double jumping off a cliff when I had no intentions of doing that make me want to listen to Drake.
my first souls game and I've enjoyed it plenty. there's a learning curve but it isn't all that hard to get over it.
mhm
Rogier is useless
Gaming game
Given all the hype this game received, well, eventually I should probably learn to not trust "professional" game reviewers.  I'm not sure if this is the studio's first open world game, but it sure feels like it.  It's a bland and boring (but beautiful) world with no direction and incredibly repetitive mechanics that become boring after the second dungeon you go through.  You don’t need direction in a linear game like dark souls (rather, its linear nature IS the direction).  But open world games need at least some of it. Given all the hidden secrets in this world, I can tell just how much effort the devs put into crafting it.  But with how they just point you in a vague direction and say “go kill that boss to advance!”, they utterly fail their lovingly crated world by not giving the user any real reason to explore it.  I saw a lot of reviewers saying that you should use a notepad with this game to keep track of side quests because there is not quest log.  If your players are having to use external tools to keep track of something in the game, that’s a failing on the game’s part.  It does not add to the experience or mystique of the game.  In fact, it detracts, since you have to consciously put the game aside to take notes.  I didn’t get far enough into the game to really judge how much you’d have to use the wiki to find secrets and solve puzzles, but if what little I did get is an indication of the rest of the game, then another symptom of the lack of direction is just how often people have to search online to figure out how to find something or what to do next.  Again, if your players are have to use external tools to play the game, it’s a failing of the game.  I've yet to find any appreciable story after 15 hours of play.  And no, a few lines of dialogue every now and then are NOT story.  They're a pathetic attempt to pretend to have a story.  Maybe if I played longer, I'd see more interesting content and more story, but if I'm not seeing any real story even after I down the first major boss, I do not count that as having a story.  It's flavor text, at most.  As a final note on the negatives:  This is a lazy console port.  Framerate is capped at 60, Field of View is too narrow for computer screens, and not adjustable.  Interface is taken directly from the console, and that's almost never a good thing for a PC game.  Control scheme has terrible pre-bound keys, and commands that should really be split between multiple keys on a PC are bound together.  Additionally, there are a number of commands that can not be re-bound.  Number keys can not be bound to any commands.  And there's probably more that I'm forgetting about.  This game is playable with a kb/mouse, would probably be better with a controller, but REALLY needed a interface/control rework for PC.  As for the last part, let me preface this by saying it does NOT factor into my negative review, because I know many people very much so enjoy the souls-like model.  This was my first souls like game, and it turns out I do NOT enjoy the punishing mechanics that you have to corpse drag through to learn fights.  I get that others do, and I won't review it negatively because of that.  Though piece of advice, if you think you won't like the punishing challenge of the souls-like model, do not buy a souls-like game, you'll just be miserable.  If you don't have really good reactions, you won't be able to handle combat in this game.  People say git gud, and that's the kind of game this is.  I just have no interest and do not enjoy it.  Again, this is not why I'm giving the game a negative review, just a warning to anyone who might be looking to try the souls like model.
I've played GoW Ragnarok just before this- loved every minute of it. However, Elden Ring just provides a level of exploration that is so much more exceptional than anything that came out in the past few years. At the point of this comment, I'm 58 hours in and just managed to get into the [spoiler]Land of the Giants[/spoiler]. So yes, the game is very long and I doubt I've explored enough of the existing area.
Really fun game! I hadn't played a FromSoftware game before this one and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by how good it is.  If you enjoy Zelda games or The Elder Scrolls you'll probably love this.  There's just something special about it.  Have some patience and don't be afraid to use the internet for help; this is a community-based game.
Best fromsoft game so far. 10/10
Its Souls.  Its canon. Play it.
Do I recommend this game? If you like souls like games, then absolutely. If you’ve never played one I’ll still recommend it but keep some things in mind like making your decision to buy. It’s a souls like game so of course it’s incredibly difficult, but rewarding when you finally master combat and/or defeat an enemy. The graphics look great and the premise is solid. RPG style gameplay is so-so. You have no guidance, meaning there’s no quest markers. You run around the world finding dungeons and NPCs for quests and it’s not always clear what to do next. You don’t get a helping hand. This isn’t a negative per say, it just adds to the games challenge. A warning though, if you die, you drop your collected experience and must re-acquire it. If you die again before collecting it you lose it forever. It’s a great mechanic in my opinion, just a friendly warning.   Combat is great most of the time but incredibly frustrating other times. Sometimes the controls are unresponsive or buggy. Enough so that if you’re an average skilled player you’ll lose your experience more to a bug than actually being bested by the games challenges. You’ll randomly stop blocking for a second, enough for a boss to get a clean hit in. Rolling/dodging is unresponsive sometimes. And because it’s a difficult game, a single mistake can mean defeat. I’d much rather lose to making the wrong decision, like dodging into an attack or mistiming a dodge. Mind you, I’m not referring to times when you get locked by animation, like healing or swinging your weapon. It’s when you’re standing still, and it won’t roll.  Doesn’t make the game unplayable and it doesn’t happen often, but it makes the game far more frustrating that it needs to be. Getting bested is one thing, losing all of your experience because of a bug is another. Again, it’s not terrible, just an advanced warning to approach combat cautiously.  Overall, I’ll recommend the game if you like a challenge. If you’re intrigued by the concept but are intimidated by the difficulty, you could try an easier souls like game like Jedi: Fallen order first. It’s pretty easy as far as souls style games go and doesn’t go into too much depth, but the combat is polished and rewarding.
still a very easy game.

Onion Ring is as good as it is tasty, 10/10, a game like this one only happen every decade or more
 Best game I have played in over a decade. Easily give it my nod for GoTY, and envision myself coming back to this game for some time. If you ain't played this game yet, wtf are you doing?
Beautiful artwork and gory violence. A little hard to follow the story line but worth figuring out!
I bought this game a long time ago and just couldn't get into it. I played the first Souls game but just couldn't get into 2 or 3. I thought Elden Ring was similar.   However, every time I was bored with other games, I'd load it up and mess around with it. I'd get frustrated because it took forever to walk everywhere (I stayed away from game guides). I'd get frustrated and stop playing. A couple of months and I'd fire it up and start all over with a new character. Then I was visited while resting and realized I had access to a horse. But, it was clunky to open the menu, click on the Torrent ring and go back to the game. Then I realized there was equipment slots for quick use. Awesome. I slowly began learning the mechanics of the game and learned it by getting slaughtered. I learned how to level up. I learned how to heal. I learned what so much of the game does. I even accidentally found myself in someone else's game and helped him defeat a boss. I didn't remember what I did so I had to try things again until it happened a second time. There's still things I haven't figured out, but that's okay. Like I haven't figured out how to get someone else to join me to defeat a boss. I've done them ny myself. I'm now working on Lyndell Royal Capital and just can get past a certain area. Not because of a boss or anything like that. I can't figure out where to go. I can finally kill things pretty quickly even bosses. I dual wield swords (both buffed to +8 and magic and Flame damage, wield the Golden Halbred +7 on Torrent and am happy to use a bow for tough distance fights.  So, what do I think of the game a year later? I love it. I love the fact I am having to learn how it works and what I have to do just to get the mechanics of it working like it should. Its a pleasure to have a game not tell me what to do for every aspect of the game. It's about a journey and it's been one hell of a journey. I'm addicted now.
Seems well optimized. It ran fine on hardware that it should run fine on.  There might as well not be music, there are vague slow tones, regardless of what's happening. Combat is slow going, extremely clunky, and unsatisfying.  The gameplay seems to be wandering around and either killing something easily, or dying. Control scheme is reasonable, but inconsistent, and seemingly an afterthought for the PC market.  Graphics are average, if not slightly above. The world has some kind of desaturated filter on it that makes everything seem dull. It's a blurry mess unless you turn off motion blur and depth of field.  The art is good and consistent, which makes up for some of the visual shortcomings of the game. The plot in 2 hrs of play is totally incoherent. There's a lot of exposition in cutscenes without any bearing. The few characters you talk to dialogue dump about what I can only assume matters later. I would consider the writing below average. In 2 hrs of play, I leveled up, which increased some stats that didn't impact anything in a noticeable way. I got some armor that increased some stats which also seemingly had no impact.  This game reminds me of old dreamcast games from the bargain bin..It'd be an absolute gem if it cost $5 and  I only owned 4 or 5 other games, but with modern gaming, there is fierce competition and this did not hook me. Normally I am okay to 'wait and see' but with all the rave reviews it caught, this game was an extreme disappointment.
Before I played this, I had a small wee wee, no girlfriend and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
recomiendo
its not a good game, its complicated and completely unreliable. It requires you to search shit up to figure it out, its bad and i wouldn't even recommend it to my teenage son. stupid bitches made this game for clout i swear to god.
Elden Ring was my introduction to the Souls series of games-- and I think it might also be my stopping point.  I had not played any Dark Souls games prior to this point, and the style of 3D combat was brand new to me at the outset. I was not foreign to difficult games, but most of the souls-like games I'd gotten good at by this point were 2D platformers and metroidvanias! Making the adjustment to camera controls was a learning curve and not being able to see everything at once tended to be a bit frustrating (at least at the start).   That said, I knew the internet was an essential resource for the souls genre and a few beginners-guides later I was adapting to the game's language with relative ease. If this is your entry point, please, do yourself a favor and make a few google searches on easy class types and beginner's guides! You'll save yourself an immense amount of headache in the future.  Once I was able to adapt to the style of gameplay, the world really opened up for me. I was BLOWN AWAY by the scale of the game-world and it's (relative) depth and detail. I found myself repeatedly enamored, shocked, and awed by the amount of impressive locations! This game does something that I genuinely appreciate: it is not afraid for you to not see all of it's content. Games like those produced by Ubisoft and others are determined to scatter a myriad of location markers and it takes all of the fun out of exploration (especially when said locations are copy-paste activities).  But even a game world like Elden Ring's cannot avoid the curse of padding in some areas: particularly, the repeated cave dungeons and ruins started to become much less and less exciting. Running into them and trying to clear them out for items became a chore when I'd gotten through the brunt of the game's world but they're a necessity for progression due to the items they contain.   That said, I think that it's much less atrocious in a game like Elden Ring and the world makes up for it in many ways; It's time I told you about my eclectic approach to discovery within this game's world.  When I set out from the start, I ended up receiving a single map for the start of the game. The remaining game world was covered in unmarked brown spotted with clouds. A tiny neuron (or demon, depending on how you look at it) ignited and told me that I now NEEDED the full map of the game. This became my primary desire in the game moving forward: fill the map. Before I wanted to explore anything thoroughly, I would have to get the whole map. For games like Breath of the Wild, I was able to do this exact strategy and had a great time doing so.   For Elden Ring, however, this would prove a unique challenge. Many areas of the game require items, boss completion, and a good deal of exploration to find ways to access. I took to the challenge and immediately began pushing in all directions to see how far I could go with very little upgrades and levels. To spare you the details of my entire journey (spoilers) this was incredibly difficult, but I managed to pull it off. I made it to the final mapped area of the game and had completed the set!  From here, I began to explore the world more thoroughly and found it a great joy to go back to starting areas with my big boy items and absolutely cheese earlier challenges in the game. I made discoveries, I beat bosses, I played the game and had a lot of fun doing so: but it was around here that I discovered what I'd been enjoying most about the game and why that was about to change.  You see, I was getting almost all of my enjoyment out of exploration. Once I'd managed to do almost all of that (I am currently located in the endgame areas having explored almost all of the world prior but only haven beaten about half the major bosses) my enjoyment of the game was severely drying up. If I'm being honest, I am not a huge fan of the combat in this game.  Do NOT get me wrong, it is a superbly designed system which no doubt has been refined over the course of the Souls series, it provides a HUGE amount of strategic options (which I enjoyed making the most of as a Bleed-Build Warrior), and is accessible for a pretty wide range of skill levels, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Like I mentioned earlier, the 3D environment makes it difficult for me to get a full picture of what's going on sometimes. The way the world is set up, enemies and bosses either tend to be really easy or stupidly difficult. I hate the four century wind-ups and waiting periods on some bosses, and while there were highlights, I would often give up direct approaches and trying to be good at dodging (as a melee build) and would eventually resort to either over-leveling, cheesing with summons, or any alternative strategy that would get me PAST the boss-fight and onto the cool new areas to explore.   To put it more succinctly, once there was little left to explore, the core gameplay of Elden Ring didn't really entice me. I think it's a fantastic game that will stick out in my mind for a long time to come, but it has given me the impression that this was the only game in the Souls series that's going to appeal to me. That said, I HIGHLY recommend anybody interested in this game give it a go, as my experience will likely not resemble yours. I recommend you take your time with it and if you get stuck, don't be afraid to look up some help! I heard someone describe this game as "the dream game of 90's RPG developers" and I agree. 9.0/10.
Game is fun to play
no one should ever put themselves through this horrible game 10/10

You can spend hours and hours and still the game grows in action and in lore.  Amazing
PROS: + not gonna lie, this game is very pretty. Each region has something unique. + you can try various build, even mage build is pretty good in ER (I hate mage build on DS because it sucks on bosses). + the sound, especially boss battle theme is really fkn good. + I like every main boss fight, except for malenia  CONS: - ER has humongous map, too bad they recycle a lot of dungeon and reskin bosses - fps locked to 60 - enemy has wall hack vision and can clip attack you through the wall - malenia has artificial difficulty, I am not having fun even after beating it. I need to use ashes too for beating it, while other bosses aren't. - no side quest tracking or such. It really confusing to follow each npc quest, where to go or what to do. - sometimes it felt a bit boring, maybe just me, but the world feel empty, the only one that move beside you is the enemy, npc mostly just stand still waiting for you to interact, - dragon enemies have inconsistent target locked, some dragon can lock to their leg, some don't. Why is that?  Overall this game is a bit overrated. 7/10 for me. I prefer dark souls 3 and sekiro.
:(
Very good. 10/10
good game
this shit is obsessive
cool game but i cant find Elden Ring idk where he is

I loved the massive sized open world, the never ending amount of builds you can do, and the controls are smooth. Beautiful game, beautiful music, very diverse in the maps, enemies, story lines, items, and more.
Great game to experience, lots todo, good story, and a fun experience with friends!
94% of Elden Ring will easily be in your top 10 favourite games, and the remaining 6% will [i]literally[/i] be the worst game you've ever played. It's like FromSoft had a "bring your kid to work day" and let them design some of the encounters.
good
good luck
don't buy less you want to lose countless hours of your life...and still counting...
I hate this game
i scratched my nuts for one second and died 
it gud
I don't like Souls games. I suck at Souls games. Bounce right off 'em. I didn't even like THIS game at first; it spits you into a hostile world, points you vaguely in a direction likely to get you killed and tells you to figure it out. That isn't immediately fun.  But then I started experiencing things I'd never associated with Souls before: A huge variety of weapons, with fighting styles and animations to match. Enormous freedom to build your character, including impressive magic systems (I'd always just associated Souls with fairly dry sword-and-shield combat). Exploration is always rewarding, with oodles of actually-useful, unique goodies to be found in the world's various nooks and crannies. A decent roster of summons to help with tough encounters, and many other tools to approach challenges. And while it does punish you in a way other games don't, you stop minding after a while and are never stuck in one spot, even at an important story boss. The art direction is superb, capturing both brightness and ominous dark. The game is so freeform that your way through it might be alien to another player, yet it feels rich and complete in a way that is rare in the era of microtransactions, battle passes etc. Elden Ring refreshingly has none of that.  Cons? The game needed a journal. Quests can break if you make the wrong bit of progress at the wrong time, and you'll frequently hit a roadblock because you haven't poked the right illusory wall in the right dungeon out of a hundred or so or didn't talk to that one guy in that backwater ruin enough times. This isn't a dealbreaker; most of the fun is emergent and I actually felt more involved by starting up a pen-and-paper journal to track stuff. The lore is good, and creatively imparted, but it exists to serve the gameplay and build the immediate world, so don't go in expecting depth on the level of Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Horizon, etc. (Sorry Souls fans, I know this is a point of pride.) The tone is also relentlessly depressing. The game world is pretty much post-apocalyptic, and outside a handful of NPCs the only people are maddened or otherwise hostile. Don't get attached to any of the characters you meet because there are almost no happy endings for any of them. I had to remind myself to come up for air occasionally to avoid it affecting my IRL mood. Performance isn't perfect even a year post-launch, with some unusual frame drops here and there, but it still ran okay on my old laptop as well as my stronger desktop. KBM controls are atrocious; you’ll want a controller.  None of this brings Elden Ring down. It's a deeply involving experience that has dominated two months of my life, and I don't regret it. It won't hold your and through any part of it I still don't know if these games are really my thing, but Elden Ring will stick with me for a long time for a lot of good reasons. I can think of several different builds and weapon classes I want to go back and try, and there are a couple of areas and major bosses I haven't even touched yet, never mind the other endings. Easy 9/10. 
A very very stellar 'Souls' game. So much lore, so many stories, such beautiful scenery. If you like souls games and you like open world I would 10000000% recommend Elden Ring.   Also you can gain a maiden :)
good
Elden Ring is an amazing, beautiful, and fun game that I would play for hundreds of hours more.
Likely contender for Greatest Game of All Time, a modern masterpiece refined to virtual perfection.
Pretty goated ngl
Just beat it, overall pretty good
Perfect game
i like to bite humans
i cant recommend this game enough i loved from the start and loved the new game plus but i cant recommend this game enough
👍
I love hot gay sex
yes
Uncontested Game of the Year! I am half a play through away from completing this game and after I do I know I will be ready to go back for more! Incredible story, game play, sound track, and visuals. You could not ask for a more fun RPG!

A grandiose addition to the souls-like genre. After nearly 100 hours of gametime I have yet to complete the main game because of the vast variety of options given to the player. Underground exploration, hidden dungeons, boss fights with different vibes and a living world with NPCs that have more to say with their dialogue and stories than you've seen in a souls-born game to date. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for any fans of the genre and even to those that simply enjoy an open world RPG. The challenges increase with the classic "YOU DIED" energy looming over you every step of the journey and experience is the best teacher you'll find here. With so much packed into the world you aren't going to be fully grasping the game until perhaps your 3rd or 4th playthrough.  10/10 would and will recommend to any that would hear about this gorgeous yet soulcrushing game
This game has genuinely ruined my enjoyment of any other games, fromsoft has done it again. 100/10 played in 3 times.
Never saw the ring
but hole
Best game i have played in my life
Top Tier Game
the best game i ever played on steam. open world and u can play whatever playstyle u like!
very good game just play past limgravy and then you will be amazed
big tree
While frustrating and downright annoying at times, the open world journey in Elden Ring is fun and captivating. Definitely recommend the game. I wish the story was a bit less cryptic and the quests were a bit easier to keep track of. I also wish the ending had more of an accomplished feel to it. But again all in all a great game. One of the only times I have replayed a game for a second journey!
L game
Very good game
Good game and very few glitches. Also is it just me or do the dogs look funky?
Hardest, most frustrating, ruthless and beautiful game Ive ever played. In its challenge lies its beauty and sense of reward. can you say, best game evr...
Well put together, the magic system isn't broken, and doesn't make non magical combat obsolete.
good gam
ITFUN
Tis a good game
I have no more hair after playing this game. I didn't have any before, but I still don't have any after.
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD
I've made a whole world burn just to save my two waifus  . . . 10/10
amazing game :)
Finally, Berserk with the good ending.
Best open world game I have ever played. Mods help if you want to replay the game. PvP isn't as good as Dark Souls 3 but still a 10/10 game.
Elden Ring is in my opinion the best open-world action RPG that I've ever played, the world is huge and you get to freely roam around it. The combat is better than other souls games, with more skills and upgrades. A truly amazing experience, yes it's filled with struggle and rage, but when you eventually succeed it's so bloody worth it.
Great game!
Ah, Elden Ring, the game that's so easy even a blindfolded monkey with one hand tied behind its back could beat it.  I mean, sure, the bosses are giant, imposing monsters that will make you feel like an ant in comparison, but once you figure out their weak points, they're about as threatening as a kitten with a ball of yarn.  And those open-world areas? Please. Who needs a map or a compass when you can just wander aimlessly and stumble upon all the hidden secrets and treasures without breaking a sweat?  And don't even get me started on the combat. It's like the game is playing itself. Just mash some buttons and watch as your character effortlessly decimates everything in its path.  Sure, you might die a few times, but that's just to give you a false sense of challenge. The truth is, this game is about as difficult as a Sunday crossword puzzle.  So if you're looking for a game that's so easy it's practically a walk in the park, then Elden Ring is the game for you. Just don't forget to bring a picnic basket and a frisbee, because you'll have plenty of time to enjoy the scenery.
IMPECCABLE
Amazing
I like killing helpless humans
Margit
the game is a god damn master piece buy the game
Dog
not fun
Played a little bit, so far so good
I spent 20 hours in the colosseum spamming the same 10 spells   And I'd do it again
Not addicted
Should come with free therapy sessions included
This is a good game for peeps who like good scenery and action. Words cannot describe how good this game is. Overall it is game of the year.
Godrick the grafted more like godick the gay hahahahah
if you like souls-like or souls games, you should definitely buy this game, amazing graphics and combat game play, cool bosses and pretty big map, if you start to play this you cannot stop playing this, you have so much things to discover in this big open world,   i recommend this game
Elden Screenshot

yes
Pretty easy baby game, good if you've got nothing better to do. People who think this is hard haven't played Sekiro
try finger buthole
Love the game! I will say it's a bit unforgiving for beginners. Think Breath of the Wild, but less cartoony and more difficult. I recommend looking up walkthroughs for tough areas. It's easy to accidentally stumble into difficult boss battles, and you risk losing all of your soul. The game gets more rewarding as you keep playing, but it does take an immense amount of patience. I've played for 42 hours and I have no idea where the main story, which I honestly think is cool.  Highly recommend for people who like side quests and exploring.
Good entry into the FromSoftware Games... except for malenia. Will make you tilt but I kept on coming back.

Behold! The Elden Ring.
AMAZING
Probably one of the best fantasy games I have played in a long time. Blown away by how beautiful some of the locations are to the point I actually stopped playing to take in the view.  I love the world and the stories that exist therein. Have spent hours reading and speaking to any and all NPC's I can to engage with the story (both what has happened in the past and what is going on now) to the point that I actually care about the NPC's that exist in game.  It has been a long time since I have felt so engaged with a game. Being left to explore and learn by myself makes discovering any detail so rewarding. The game does give you small hints to stuff here and there and once you learn to read into these you start to feel a sense of excitement as to where it will lead you.  If this is your first Fromsoftware game my advice is to not give up! Yes it can feel a little daunting as to where to go and why, yes you will die over and over and over again but if you persevere it is worth it in the end!
I love getting my ass handed to me on a platinum platter
yep
Great game, completely immersive. My wife hates it.
W
buy it or you're gay 
great game and have fun every second of it

Best of the Souls-Games  Amazing open world and super fun gameplay. Also, Dog  10/10
New mix on the already good souls series.
This is my first souls that I have ever played or experience, and I'm glad it is my first
Is good.
Depression
I've been playing Elden Ring for a while now, and so far, I'm thoroughly impressed. I'd give it a rating of 4.5 out of 5 based on my experience with the game. Although it's sometimes hard, it's still a lot of fun. I remember finding it especially challenging at the beginning, but as I play the game more and more, I find myself enjoying it more.  The story is excellent and immersive, and it's one of the things that makes Elden Ring a must-play. Although I haven't finished it yet, I'm enjoying the experience so far, and the story has been captivating. In my opinion, the story is a little long, but in a good way, as it allows for a more immersive and engaging experience.  Overall, I'd highly recommend Elden Ring to fans of action RPGs. Although the game can be challenging at times, it's definitely worth the effort. The story is well-crafted and immersive, and the gameplay is engaging and rewarding. If you're looking for a fun, challenging, and immersive gaming experience, Elden Ring is a great choice.
Honestly, at first I didn't think id like this game. But after buying it for the low price of 40 euros I was still considering refunding it. At first the game didn't seem too great, but after killing a couple bosses I could see what the game has to offer and all I got to say that it's amazing! Definetly worth the money and my time
good game but cannot sex the elden beast
This Game is pure gold yes its hard and theirs no explanation to how to play but im sure with enough tutorials or just playing it raw will make it all for the experience 
this is a horror game
awesome game still havent gotten through it but keep coming back
Probably the best open world fantasy RPGs I have ever played. The world creation, level design, art, direction, music, items, everything had so much depth. The game is rich with content and is an absolute steal for its price. It has to be one of the very few games in which multiple playthroughs feel equally exciting and rewarding. I can't wait for a DLC so that I can dive back into this beautiful world.
Yes
As a soulskiro veteran I massively recommend this game. It keeps the dark souls feel but changes it up enough to still surprise and challenge me.
One of the games ever
One of the best game that i've ever played.
pretty cool
it makes me want to hurt people which is goob
This was my first soulsborne game, so my review won't have any bias to Dark Souls nor will include any comparison to previous FromSoftware games. What I can say is that, one might be overwhelmed when they hear how hard this game is, I mean they are absolutely correct however, hard doesn't mean that it is unbeatable. I have died countless times but kept playing it because I was immersed with its lore, its world, characters and of course, the challenge that comes with it. This game definitely deserves its "game of the year" status in 2022.
Thankfully you can hold a woman and see many dogs in game because I haven't left my house in over a week.  All I've done, all I think about, all I want to do, is play Eldin Ring.
I cried so much when it got GOTY.Trully deserved it.A true gem.
12/10 game.
Incredible worldbuilding and such, any fans of hollow knight or dark souls will love
Probably as close to a 10/10 as it gets for me. Biggest gripe is some of the design for the later-game bosses leaves things to be desired. But that's a personal grievance.
FOUL TARNISHED  IN SEARCH OF THE ELDEN RING  EMBOLDENED BY THE FLAME OF AMBITION  SOMEONE MUST EXTINGUISH THY FLAME
Simply WOW
I'm getting good
Elden ring is a beautiful story of a prince who sets off on an adventure to save a princess. But along the way he overcomes a lot of obstacles and forgets his main objective. Instead, he trains to eat soup with a fork. Masterpiece. 11/10 would recommend.
too easy

Just killed Malenia to finish the game. Just buy it. Longest game i have ever finished which is saying a lot as it had to be really good for me to want to finsh it over the past year!
Didn't really like it at first as cause of how buggy it was, but with the recent updates it feels looks and feels alot smoother. The game does feel alot easier and funner on NG+ when you have your weapons and skills upgraded! If you love Dark Souls it's a definite buy!!! PRAISE THE SUN!
Best game. Period.
if i ever see another godskin or ulcerated tree spirit i will tear my eyes from their sockets
too hard broke soul
Sooooo good!
I was really bad at this at first. Then I tried finger but whole. Now I am elden lord but still bad.   Best RPG since Skyrim.
As always with FromSoftware this is an incredible game.
Good shit 
Legitimately one of the best games ever made.
i touch a woman for the first time, definitely game of the year
yes. 
One of the best games I've ever played
This game is a really great start for new souls like players or for people have have  all ready played a souls like over all 10 out of 10 great game.
FAILED TO LOAD SAVE DATA! -100h
play it
I love the great graphics and the amazing storyline
-9000/10 best game never never
 sword, swing, kill hahaha
"Hey mogh, do you know cand-" "I AM FUCKING YOUR BROTHER!!" BAHM, BAHM, dun dun dun dun, dun, dun dun dun "MOOOOOOOOOORBIUS

Really good.
when DLC?
very good very nice
yes
Very good game. The biggest problem is that I suck at it
Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The boss design is so unique and fun while also doing a great job on balancing difficulty and challenge. This game is brutal, but only if you want to, as the gameplay molds with your playstyle. I'm so glad games like this exist. No microtransactions, hundreds of hours of fun content, great replayability. Overall Elden Ring exceeds in both quality and quantity. What a game!
All the hype made me a bit dubious but after completing the game I think it actually is that good.
good game
Elden nuts
its the best game ever made
Almost overwhelmingly massive open world that my monkey brain had a lot of fun exploring. I encountered a couple skill issues but nothing that can’t be solved by just cloning myself.  Still some performance issues, but I’m also just about on recommended System Requirements so yeah there’s that.  Go play, this is about as good as it gets for souls games. 
makes me cry
lost all your exp in a run, but you should not delete it yet
My PC cant handle it so i couldn't play anything except character creation I got it on sale tho so good game  overall 10/10 game
Its not fun at all putting X³ number of hours and leveling your character to a pretty high value, having somewhat legendary equipment and passing into second half of the game and still being utterly humiliated by 2 little goblins with pointy sticks. Not my cup of tea.  Visually the game is astounding, but the progress and learning curve is just way beyond any measure of playing this game "relaxed". You feel like an intelligent worm that sometimes gets a nice shiny stick and picks up new dress, but the game repeatedly reminds you that you are still a petty worm.
GOAT
this game is top tier 10/10
After almost a year with this game, after 450hrs or so playing this game on and off, completing all the achievements, playing with multiple characters, with my friends, dabbling in pvp and invasions, and slight bit of modding.  I can proudly say it was worth the hype.  I'll assume people familiar and those who have played previous FromSoft titles have already played this so for those WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR with the souls series and are wondering if it is worth playing. It is. I played this with two friends who have never played a soulsborne game in their life and we thoroughly enjoyed it. There are a few caveats for a new player but I'll base this both on my personal experience and my friend's opinions on our journey. Here are some things to consider.  * I'll preface what you need to consider before buying the game with this. This is a long game. You will have to devote a lot of hours into this game. Mind you, not just at one sitting but it will be a while to finish a new game. It can go from 60~150hrs for a first playthrough depending on how much you want to explore and how good you are at the game. So consider that this isn't an over the weekend type of game and if you are fine with that, then let's move on. * This is an action-rpg, you will have to learn the mechanics of the game and be somewhat adept to it. That goes for both understanding the role-playing aspects and the technical aspects of playing the game. Mashing 1 button with your starting gear can work for a while but without learning how to upgrade, using talisman's, boss mechanics, enemy and level layouts, you're gonna have a bad time. FromSoft's level design is impeccable and you'll slowly pick all of this up intuitively if you pay attention to what the game tells you. * There is no difficulty slider, there is one difficulty and that's it. Your playthrough's difficulty will depend on your play-style and how much you want to delve into the numerous in-game mechanics of the game. There is nothing wrong with asking for help, looking for help, and searching for help. Whether it be youtube, the wiki, reddit, or online players, it's fine as long as you're enjoying. * Co-op is super fun but is also annoying (sometimes). Traditional in-out multiplayer is not what Elden Ring offers, while I am familiar with Dark Souls co-op, invasions, and pvp, my friends were not. It takes about 3-5 sessions with friends before they'll get used to it and stop complaining. There are also invasions where the most fun and frustration was had. Pretending to be chairs and watching an invader get confused then corner themselves was fun but you'll also get the occasional god who can just destroy you as you run towards a boss. So, in conclusion, it's fun, convoluted, frustrating and the most unique multiplayer experience we had.  * Have fun. This is a challenging game, but a lot of enjoyment can stem from that challenge. IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Anyone can play it but that does not mean they will enjoy it. If you feel that you won't enjoy the game, that's fine, it doesn't mean you are a lesser gamer for it. You can revisit the thought of playing someday. However, if you have been craving for a different experience from your typical open-world, map marker, get into the top of the tower and unlock the map game, then this might be a refreshing and even life changing experience for you. The game's approuch to open-world deisgn is phenominal. Interconnected zones that are inhabited with such unique enemies and are leveled in a way that doesn't seem unfair (at least not at the first half of the game). These zones intuitively show you where to go and how to get into them. So enjoy the feeling of exploring the beatiful world created by Miyazaki and his team. And if you do choose to buy this game, welcome fellow Tarnished, into The Lands Between.   Serious Critique Time:  (Here I put some of the things I observed that can I found viable for discussion)  * Performance - during the first week, the performance was abbysmal and while it got better over time, I am still getting dips from certain areas. I'm sure this won't happen but implementing DLSS or FSR into the game may help some or even in their future games. * 60 FPS cap - I know, it's for balancing with multiplayer. I personally got my ass whooped by a dude who kept stuttering while running and attacking. This is apparently caused by unlocking framerate. I'm unsure if it's the engine, netcode, or whatever reason but other multiplayer games have found a workaround for this so maybe in the next game, it would help if they could allow us to remove the 60fps cap since they have made a push for more multiplayer. * Boss and enemy variety - I always found it a strange critique due to how many different enemy and boss designs are in the game. There is an absurd ammount of unique enemies and bosses in the game as compared to other open-world titles. Even the repeat enemies for the later half of the game are unique enough for me to not find it annoying, however, what I do find annoying is the ammount of the damage they do. * End-game difficulty spike - I like the soul's challenge but by god does it suddenly kicks you in the balls then start spitting at you as you get up. Maybe I can say it wasn't that hard because my first time through the game I did not notice it but playing it again with friends suddenly made me realize how ridiculous the damage end-game areas can do to you, especially with multiplayer scaling. I don't know why I did not feel this in my first playthrough but with subsequent playthroughs it did seem unfair in a bad way.   Overall, these are nitpicks that I found after multiple playthroughs.   I played this game on release and finished it after a month. This game is an experience and will leave you amazed and overwhelmed with how wonderful and terrifying the world is. I just can't wait to see what's next for us tarnished. Please Miyazaki, give us the DLC.

TIS IS GOOD
game of the year
10/10 one of the best.
Wanted to try out a soulsborne game so I bought this at release. Tried getting into it but was not feeling it. I tried a few months later because why not and let me tell you, I was hooked. My woman almost left me I was so hooked. So yea, I recommend. over 400 hours in across 3 platforms and I am still playing.
Great GAME of all time
The only game where dying is actually enjoyable
I have waited 6 months in the hopes of stability patches but the game still stutters for me and has lags spikes so severe the game essentially freezes. All settings on low or ultra makes no difference. My PC is a little out of date but I had no trouble playing cyberpunk on launch day with all settings ultra so I don't see why Elden Ring cannot run smoothly. I will never buy another From Software game on PC. Stick to console.
Best Indie game
pope turtle
What a majestic journey.
the game makes me wanna evaporate my own blood 10/10
oh byeah
Face those late bosses who has tracking+delay attack follow up with insane combo jump around all over the place shooting magic missiles nuke fart idk what the hell is going on is.... fun(?).  Early bosses is weak thou.  Mimic tear, the copy of your character on crack is sure make everything easier for newcomer, but don't use it if you want extra spice that probably take your sanity away.  The open world is gorgeous, there's a tree, a giant tree, glowing tree, rotten tree, transparent tree, and tree. There's also a lot variety of places that fill with creature that has no chill at all.   Story? just watch youtube video explaining the lore I guess.  Overall death out of 10.  Will die again.
I can be Guts.
w
dog? 
absolutely amazing
yeah
roll
Deep RPG elements, Charecter building, weapon upgrades, and the open world is so rich.  Hard but nothing easy is rewarding.  Experienced gamers will truely enjoy this game.
is good. hyped for elden ring 3
This is a horrible game do not buy it is a piece of shit you will want to die if you play this game dont play dont but waste of money dont buy remeber dont buy it is all a lie if someone tells you this game is good.
Elden bruh
Certified Unorthodox Rabbi moment
this game said i have no bitches which i dont but it still hurt my feelings
Very good game.
Truly an amazing title all the way through. With mods, it gets even better. Genre defining.
I really like the open world and the exploration in the game. It can get challenging but that's fixed by leveling up. I really like the options for customizing character and the ability to strengthen weapons. Very fun game
I love my mom.
if you haven't played ANY soulsborne games, seek help and put yourself in a psyche ward. This masterpiece is BEYOND anything I've ever played and I HIGHLY recommend this work of art.
You replay the game because you missed one side quest
good game 
ywa
Game is good, listen to all the bloodstained messages.
ring-like
Weenee =
Few games that I have bought since getting a pc and love it so much. It's been a while since playing it but the game is a lot of fun to play, and there is other parts to the game that you can download that make the game even more fun.
我很喜欢 BING CHILLING https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/#
It will make u cry >:) 
I experienced pain for the first time in my life. And I enjoyed it.
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
GOTY indeed
skeletal leybedev clear sky swamp aironia bloom. follow him to garbage and get robed and disharmed, take your money- use a sack official twig to avoid loss of RU. all players forgot this and became lost in the sauce of dolg and fiefdom. four castles, four great rooms. go to arndale wayhouses and find a body in the fire, realipstick event? nothing can be found and nothing can be made thats the point of the message, this is not the last one... it is the final one? new one coming out but they bombed it
I like it 
Dog, it's Elden Ring....cmon guy
good
Great game, can't wait for a dlc
Definetly one of the best that I have ever played, amazing graphics, game play, replay value and music, the story is getting better and better, is just a master piece,  is a really whole new experience and totally deserved to win game of the year.
Highly recommend.
Yes. Buy game. Torture yourself and become a better gamer. I haven't 100%'d this game yet but still, be the best gamer you can be.
The best "souls-like" game so far. Dont feel ashamed by constantly looking up guides, youtube videos, and at the elden ring wiki. its a hard game that gives little direction. The beauty, customization, mechanics, and literally hundreds of unique bosses make up for it though.
easy to get lost in this one
Too many "but hole" jokes

i cant get past the soldier of god 11 tractor beams / 1 jehovah's witness
Im not a souls like player so the difficulty is pretty off putting. On top of i perfer games with strong stories and so far this game has not displayed one im interested in, so i dont think i'd play it, even if it was easy.
Seek Dog
very good. the duo boss fights werent good though

AT LAST  IM NOT MAIDENLESS!!! YESSSS   [spoiler]NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! WHY MARKIA WHY???[/spoiler]
Praise the game, Therefore don't give up
dont buy game shits Itself while you are tryna play at 35fps
i liked everything
my second ever souls game after ds1r. i got it two or so months after launch, while the online was still fairly active, and it was really fun at the time. it still is as long as you play with the seamless co-op mod, like everybody else is doing. why from software has not implemented similar multiplayer into a souls game themselves yet is beyond me. it is by far the most enjoyable way to play this game, especially with the absence of covenants in this title. invading feels like an optional chore you can do for no reward other than the experience. if you like the experience, that's great, but the incentive is sorely missed for me. the latter half of the game can be a slog and serves little purpose other than ensuring a full run take upwards of 50 to 60 hours. if you have friends to play elden ring with, then i can't recommend this game enough. otherwise, play dark souls 3. 8/10 with seamless, 6.5/10 without.
eldn
Mage people suck
No idea what am I going to do or where am I? who am I ? what am I going to achieve, But is nice to roam in the game.
it won game of the year for a reason if you have the money and want a good challenge then this game is a must have
good
I'm a very relaxed gamer.  I'm 50.  I don't like big challenges.  This game is close to perfect.  Having issues defeating bosses?  Level a little.  Or a lot!  The mechanism for this game is better than past souls games.  Just a great game, period!
I was sceptical at first when buying this game because i had never played a souls game before, but i can say now after completing elden ring its the best game i have ever played, Highly recommend any one who wants this game to get it 10/10.
ta bueno
Best sense of exploration you can probably experience in a game, coupled with it's intensely grueling combat makes for a heavily rewarding game.
amazing game
9/10  A more or less open world Souls game, and it works really well. Plenty of bosses, builds, and places to explore, even though the game doesn't tell you much of anything besides kind of where to go.
best game in at least a decade if not more
a boring, poorly-balanced shadow of Fromsofts past of designing tight, good-feeling games. the story and the aesthetics are top quality, and stand proud against the rest of the series, but every other core part of the soulsian experience has been gutted to deliver a large world with a sprawling story. the coop is muted and fairly pointless to be summoned by, invaders are either gangbanged by hunters and summons or blatantly min maxing builds just for the rush they get at the "host killed" screen. the boss fights have poor timing that are incongruous with the pace of the character. the bloated systems and half assed renditions of good ideas from previous games are lost in a whirlwind of sketchy combat, landscapes meant to be walked around until you find a cave worth exploring, and dungeons too small and too repetitive in design aesthetic and enemy types that the whole, massive world feels like the same area with the same enemies and the same annoying reasons to send you to the nearest checkpoint with a slightly different coat of paint on it. im sad to saay fromsoft have lost their moxy in taking on a project that they honestly shouldve reeled in a time or two. play at your own risk, most people wont even find the game fun because of the core systems.
good game play now
it wont let me full screen the game
The best game of last year is still a blast to play this year. Very few things to nicpick about the game ( like reused bosses), It's the souls formula at it's best. While DS3 and Demon Souls are still above Elden Ring in terms of my favorite Souls games , it's hard to deny this is the best Souls game out there. Must buy for any Souls fan.
Explore a majestic and beautiful world in this outstanding RPG.
Best Single Player open world game I've played in a while. There is infinite replay ability in the game with the huge amount of weapons and spells to choose from.
yes this game hurts my soul but is one of the easiest souls games 
Awesome 

Best game I've played yet.
Best game ever.
I was 100% a skeptic going in. Fully turned me, phenomenal game. Beautiful. Some of the larger enemies cause some funky camera issues, but I found it not to be too bad. Loving it still, level 107 or something.
Fort,  night
Might be the best game ever made. Truly something special. Highly recommend.
Pineapple Pizza is the best Pizza
The visuals are stunning and the game play is challenging. I wish the game had better support for multiplayer but that's a souls game for ya.
Warning: you die a lot
so much to do
"git gud" Got good, my first Souls game to complete, and I think that's because this game engages you enough through customization, play-style variants, and discovery. It's a very difficult game, but with enough "carrot" that you learn to love the "stick". The best game I've ever played. It's the "Skyrim" of its time, and nothing else even comes close.
yea
Wonderful game, if you like the souls game this is a wonderful addition, and if your new this is a great place to start.
this game made me suicidal
hard but good :D
 Try finger But Hole
After the initial grind to get up to a descent level to fight stronger foes, this game becomes very enjoyable you'll still be dying A LOT, but you're at least you can see the light a bit.  Difficulty is way more forgiving than Sekiro.
best rage game
Fifteen hours into Elden Ring, I defeated Godrick, the first of five Elden Lords. In the time between emerging into the Lands Between and striking him down, I'd discovered decrepit ruins, ventured into twisting caves, stumbled upon enemy encampments, and battled tooth and nail against challenging bosses. From Software's games have always made you feel small in many ways: They tell you that you're worthless--a plague-ridden rat or accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. They ask you to navigate unflinching brutal worlds and pit you against enemies that systematically dismantle your ego. Elden Ring maintains the nail-biting combat and air of mystery that has distinguished From Software's Soulsborne games, but it's elevated to new heights by the studio's interpretation of what an open-world game can be. Having brought down Godrick, the breadth of the world--and the way in which From Software has applied its signature style to an open world--was on full display, reinforcing how insignificant I really was and driving home the magnitude of the task that still awaited me.  Standing on the edge of a cliffside in Liurnia of the Lakes, the area beyond Godrick's arena, I took in the world laid out in front of me: the enormous Erdtree casting brilliant golden beams of light onto the land that exists in its shadow; the sharp peaks of a distant mountain that look like claws tearing at the sky; a castle standing proudly amidst ruins; a forest blanketed in an ominous fog. It was all overwhelming, and none of the hardships I'd experienced in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice have come close to making me feel as small. At the same time, I was overcome with excitement for what the Lands Between had in store for me and all the seemingly insurmountable battles awaiting--and it did not disappoint.  Elden Ring is From Software's crowning achievement in world design--epic in scale and scope. But what makes it special isn't just how visually stunning it all is, or that its open-world is vast, rich in detail, and teeming with possibilities. Instead, it's how the studio has applied its own esoteric design principles to deliver an experience that feels fresh, elegant, and uniquely From Software. The game's core pillars are built on the same strong action and role-playing foundations as previous titles while offering more freedom to explore than ever before. Elden Ring is an open-world game entirely in a category of its own. That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game design.  In guiding the player, Elden Ring employs the lightest of touches. The Lands Between is truly open and offers the player complete agency in exploration, whether on foot or horseback. The world is ruled by five Elden Lords, each in possession of a shard of the titular Elden Ring. As a lowly Tarnished, you aim to defeat these corrupt lords, take their shards, stand before the Erdtree, and become an Elden Lord in your own right. With the premise established through a quick cutscene, you are let loose and left to forge a path through the world as you see fit.  A key part of From Software's design ethos is to strip down to the essentials, and in Elden Ring that process strengthens exploration and discovery, the heart and soul of the experience. The studio's games typically give the player very little while asking a lot, and Elden Ring is the most obtuse and demanding of its games so far. This is largely because everything you've come to expect from modern open-world games is absent; for instance, there's no map until you find an item that reveals the topography of a region. Even then, the points of interest in that region aren't marked until you've been there and seen them. There is no minimap, just a compass to show the cardinal directions and any waypoints you've placed.  Characters, meanwhile, aren't desperate for your attention; as with previous games, the quests they task you with aren't noted down or tracked in any kind of log--it's up to you to do your due diligence. Areas you go to won't be gated depending on your level, and there's no clear indication on when you should go to key locations. The best you get is at the Sites of Grace, which function as rest points in the same way Bonfires, Lanterns, or Idols did in other titles. At each of these sites is a dim trail of golden light pointing in the general direction of… something. Perhaps it's the next milestone in your quest or maybe it's just another area that has a dungeon--the only way to find out is to make the journey.  The challenge for From Software lies in the friction between the studio's design hallmarks and the expected conventions of a genre filled with games that try to be all things to everyone. And although the execution is an unmitigated success, one thing's for sure: Elden Ring is not a smooth-edged, one-size-fits-all kind of experience that will accommodate everyone. Instead, it's unrelentingly opaque, relishes in the savagery of confronting players with unfavorable odds, and delights in watching the ensuing struggle. Elden Ring's gameplay will feel familiar to those with experience of previous From Software games. The tried-and-true formula of measured third-person combat against enemies that are swift to punish foolhardiness is both as thrilling and nerve-racking as ever. Whether you wield a sword and shield, swing something that's closer to a heap of raw iron, or stand back as a mage and launch spells to topple your foes, Elden Ring tests patience and skill with tricky enemy mobs and ferocious bosses.

Very good game highly recommend

This game is horrible, im telling you, dont play it, my eyes were bloodshot for five hour straight, i was scared to take my eyes away from the screen, the pain i felt, the overwhelming mental pain i felt was unreal, this game was created by satan himself.
very challenging game, get ready to beat your wife
The most beautiful game I've ever seen. Miyazaki is truly an Elden Lord!  You don't have the right, O you don't have the right! Therefore, try finger but hole!
mint
worth trying on a sale, but has a significant amount of problems for the fifth entry in the lock 'n' roller + poison swamp series (6th if you count bloodborne). the gimmick this time around is the open world and the hybrid build diversity compared to the other games. consumables in this game are also significantly stronger than in the older souls games and summons are another accessibility or build tool available to players. the game suffers from strange combat feel problems and heavy content reuse, which I assume are caused from copypasting assets from sekiro and DS3. additionally, with a RTX 1070, i occasionally had microhitches during a handful of boss fights.  my playthrough was done exclusively with colossal swords, no summons in combat, limited consumables and limited magic use, so some of the complaints won't matter to those who are laser or summon enjoyers.  the combat: - attacking on the horse feels very clunky and is excessively powerful. you spend a lot of time on the horse and it ends up contributing a lot to a massive amount of dead air while exploring since any packs of enemies end up becoming busywork instead of being a threat. - the game is close to DS2 in terms of combat design, which is not a sin on its own. several fights are duos or trios, but enemies also will pace their attacks to not overwhelm the player which seems very strange given that most weapons have ways to deal with packs, unlike in DS2 - several bosses feel inappropriately boring, notably the dragon enemies that let you attack their legs for free until they die of old age. - several enemies have unique attacks that can't be easily sightread and hit like trucks. of these attacks, some have very ambiguous or no telegraphs on followups (e.g. [spoiler]radagon's wave of gold looking identical to most of the decals that he applies is a strange encounter choice, you eventually learn that his wave of gold is exclusively a frontal cone so his huge slams will never detonate[/spoiler]) that you'll only figure out either by just beating them before you run out of hp or exhaust evasion options until you find one that works. if you don't level vigor sufficiently, these fights can be particularly frustrating. additionally, there are a handful of attacks that require the player to just run away (e.g. [spoiler]Commander Niall's P2 Frostbite AoE[/spoiler] and these feel very boring to play against as there's no counterplay other than "don't be there" and imo dramatically slows the game down. - there is woefully insufficient camera settings, particularly when locked on. depth perception is a skill check depending on build. this is particularly annoying with my build as whiff punishing, stance breaking and knowing what attacks can interrupt bosses are vital to playing the game. bosses across the board have greater melee range than the player so it's very jarring when you commit and barely miss, even when the model looks like it connected. i ended up having to just fight most of my fights without the lockon and with the camera tilted up to make it clearer when it was safe to attack. additionally, some enemies can drag you with them during their command grabs which is extremely annoying if the camera moves during it. - enemies don't scale to you meaning you can very easily overlevel an area if you go out of order, which punishes exploration - the only ways to mitigate this are to either spend your runes on everything but leveling or to intentionally let them rot. - [spoiler]lake of rot[/spoiler] is an entire area dedicated to being a build check instead of a skill check. the only way to natively deal with that area is to AFK on platforms if you don't have the items or skills to reduce the burden that the area places on the player. if you have the health regeneration to deal with [spoiler]the scarlet rot without exploiting a lower level scarlet rot and then activating it[/spoiler] then you probably have also found the way to craft said items or obtain said skills, which are also missable. out of combat, debuffs that aren't fully built should decay much more rapidly. - [spoiler]rykard[/spoiler] should have been left on the cutting room floor. literal R1 spam boss with occasional skill ask - lethal fall damage past a 2 second drop is a strange include in a game that promotes exploration and punishes creative use of verticality in engagements, notably in mid-lategame areas. the only thing that killed me more than fall damage in the game was blind RL1 tree sentinel.  content reuse: the game suffers from heavy scope creep from the open world. - mines, graves, catacombs and other dungeons feel very similar. each type of location shares the same aesthetics as the rest of their family. - i fought the [spoiler]magma wyrm[/spoiler] 5 times and several bosses more than twice. even major bosses get partially reused, lmao. - some strong overworld enemies are dungeon bosses (though it might be vice-versa, which is still questionable) - the areas are so large that a lot of the locations within it are indistinct. imo, the world could have been compressed by 50% and maintained a much higher level of quality. - all weapons that aren't enemy drops are only obtainable once per playthrough. in order to get every item in the game without trading, you must enter NG++ or trade/dupe with someone else.
THE BEST GAME EVER MADE.  Honestly at first when i bought the game on release i dropped it for a long time as soon as i picked it up again i couldn't stop playing when i had finished it i just wanted to start a new game straight away cause i hadn't had enough so i did, then i went to get all the achievements.  the only game that has managed to get me excited to go home and play games since i was a child   10/10  I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella   
Elden Ring. Yeah, it's fun.
i feel like 50% of the time i played this i was bored out of my mind, but the other 50% i was having so much fun that it made me want to keep playing even when i was bored overall good game
Best FromSoftware franchise by far. You have endless builds and weapons to use, get a new one each run and have fun
100/10 game, perfect, its a beautiful masterpiece insane, visuals and world, surely one of my favorite games, the exploration basically never ends in this game.
The whole thing looks like it was made by a neural network.

Amazing!!  The art and monster design is perfect.  Much better with seamless coop mod.  Top five games of all time.
good
What an amazing game. Easily top 5 of all time in my opinion. I believe I did everything there is to do and obtained every item that I had interest in getting. All I can say is it's a masterpiece worth pushing through the struggle for.   Absolutely beautiful scenery, fluid gameplay and plenty of build options for your character.   Now to play it a second time with a friend!
good 
Game is amazing. It has amazing gameplay harder mechanics and takes more patience and skill but also has stunning visuals by far one of my favorite games ive played in years. This is also my first souls game so i cannot compare it to past ones but it is truly a great time have almost 20 hours and im not even close to being through it would recommend it 10/10
I played 20 hours in the first 24 hours of release, Elden Ring is love, Elden Ring is life.  I couldn't recommend this game more. What FromSoftware did for the MMO genre with this game is unbelievable. I believe this is the most impact-ful MMO, and most innovative MMO to come out in the past decade.
Masked Guy called me maidenless so i killed him and got some fingers.  10/10 experience
If you like the soulsborne games, i'd get to playing this immediately. If you're new to Fromsoft's action games this is also a fine game to start.
Breath of the Wild Dark Souls
boy that elden sure does ring
w game tbh 
Hard as $%@!, but an amazing game!!
good fuggin game
Just buy it it's good.
good
try fingers
Wise woman once said: If you like something, you should put a ring on it.  I'm putting a ring on this.
THIS is how games SHOULD be made. I'm 52 hours in and STILL not done... Lv 112 and died only a handful of times which means this is almost ALL pure gameplay. PROS Dark Souls Game Builds are solid Leveling is Solid Fights are Solid Difficulty is Solid Exploration and Beauty are Solid Pure Builds are Solid Music is Solid Game Play Time is Solid D.J Solid!  CONS Crafting of items could use a little love. Mobs cheese you with things YOU CANT DO... (hitting through walls) Multiplayer should have just been the default out of the gate. Mage build is stupid broken EARLY Faith takes WAAAAYYYY too long to become damage relevant. Some mobs don't stop swinging taking away the ability to backstab, not all mobs can be backstabbed or front stabbed like old souls games.   AWFUL PC control defaults... Only can cycle through items in one direction so you need to loop THE ENTIRE item set if you miss your item. Multiple Weapon Sets add weight, limiting creativity with no counter argument as to the detriment of doing so in the game. Let players carry any amount of weapons they like. Controls are backwards for weapons as default. Translations of some items are HORRIBLE... cat amulet... looking at you... Fall damage should have an additional 20 ft added to fall if pony jumps to reset. Mixed builds are almost ALWAYS irrelevant which sucks because they often try to ask you to go that route for builds. If they removed the -damage on weapons for mixed concepts, this might not have been so bad. Had giant stone dragon... that is not intended to be climbed on... such a tease... Had a giant stone tower, has nothing on it to do... Had giant boss rooms with ZERO secrets in any of them making exploration a time waster... (lost 2 hours to this...) 
hot womens and swords
i got gud
Phenomenal game.
fun but hard
fromsoft's masterpiece
Best game ever
intense
masterpiece
i would very mouch recommend it its my fav game  there isnt much to say its not for everyone though the game is very scarce on details on what to do but i think thats apart of its charm
Cant stop playing
This game took me about 180 hours to fully explore every little bit of it and it was the best adventure I've ever had in a video game. I don't even think I've explored all of what the game has to offer and I look forward to see those on subsequent play through.
elen rin
almost ripped my hair out 205 times 11/10 would reccomend  always remember: "try finger but hole"
this game is nice
This game is just good
Ist ein sehr tolles Game aber ihr braucht so ungefähr 30% mehr Nervenzellen als der durchschnittliche Mensch. Habe das Spiel jetzt auf 100% gemacht (Alle Errungenschaften) und bin froh, keinen Grund mehr zu haben dieses Siel anzufassen... All in all ein sehr tolles Spiel.
Amazing game, don't get unless you're prepared to spend all of your time obsessing over this game.
One of my favorite "Souls games" to date. I can't tell you how many hours I've put into this game on console, basically consuming my entire summer. One major thing I should recommend before buying is please use a controller. I know your a god with your half size keyboard but I'm telling you now, you will hate yourself and the game if you play this way.
great game
elden ring very good good
Honestly, this is the BEST game I've played in years. Hands down. Just buy it, and don't give up on it either. Learn the mechanics, and enjoy this masterpiece.
Where do I even begin. This game is massive and does not hold your hand. The pendulum will swing wildly between getting your ass handed to you and absolutely demolishing your foes. This provides incentive to employ strategy and explore the world, which is an absolute joy.  It conjures the same magical sensations I had when first travelling through the lands of Boletaria in Demon Souls, my previous favorite of the souls games in terms of level design. It does take some time to adjust to the feel but once you get it it's a beautiful experience.
god of war should of won
5/5 would die again
i jus wanty her bakc and my shjoes

git gud
Very good story, awesome boss fights, but a lot of grinding
If someone needs my opinion in order to play this game must have been living in a cave for the past year. Just buy it already and git gud
Masterpiece, 10,1/10. One of my personal favorite games of all time,. Cool bosses, and amazingly immersive world with countless npc's, npc questlines, and enemies to find on your journey. Difficulty: 8.5/10, story/lore: 10/10, gameplay: 9/10, and bosses: 9/10. This game has hours upon hours of content so I 100% recommend this game. Hope this helped your decision!
The programming in this game is extremely lazy, which they mask by calling it hard.  Overrated, but still good.
This game is a masterpiece. Now i think i won't be able to feel the same satisfaction with the rest :')
Amazing game. Makes me wanna pull my hair out

good game, hard game but good game 
Elden Ring is a fantastic and overall HUGE game that From Software has published last year. The combat is fun (especially if you are using an INT build and you can just OHKO bosses with Comet Azur lol) and the overall open world of the game is simply gorgeous.  I also have to give credit to the developers, because they did a really good job at optimizing the game, since it runs smoothly at 40-50 FPS on a 1050Ti (1080P Low/Mid settings), which is a lot for a GPU which came out many years ago.  The only minor inconvenience that I have found with this game is that some bosses are way too frustrating to handle for an average gamer (Malenia, for instance): it seems to me as if the developers have wanted to make this type of bosses overly complicated on purpose, making them very unbalanced in the process.  In conclusion, I recommend this game to everyone! Even if Souls-Like games are not your typical to-go game, it's still worth giving Elden Ring a shot. And if you find yourself stuck on a bossfight, you don't necessarily have to lose your mind and "git gud", you can just summon a bunch of friends and have fun!
boob 
Another good iteration of the Souls series. Quite similar to previous Souls games so if you liked them you will like this one.   Nothing major has really changed since before but there are some differences such as the following. Its open world so there is more flexibility to do other things if you get stuck on a boss. There is even better atmosphere and bigger scale than previous ones. You can teleport to any Lost Grace site (bonfire) at anytime from the beginning. You also get recharges of the health and magic potions as you progress through areas and kill enemies, this makes it possible to go for longer times between Grace sites.  Its typical Souls, if you don't know what Souls is like nowadays then a.) you should crawl out from under your rock a bit more often and b.) try it!
Why is it always weak foe...?
my favorite game sense i got it
If you're curious about souls-likes, this game is a very good entry point. Sure the quests are cryptic, some bosses are a pain and sometimes you feel the game wants you to uninstall it because of how much anger it instils in you. But for everything else... it's a masterpiece.
if you want to beak the desk and PC play this game solo or if you want to have fun play with friend
Best game ever
hi
One of Fromsoft best titles. Unsure on why they have not released a DLC yet, there is so much cut content is insane. I hope they will add it later on, anyway Modders will keep this game alive for the next decades
very funny
I once was killed by an invader who used gravity magic to pull me into the pit underneath an elevator like I was a Three Stooges bit   I once killed someone as an invader by shooting them with a giant magic arrow (!!!) while scaling rooftops in a volcano town (!!!)  This game has everything. Play this game.
Best game ever
just buy it
Good, yah!
A masterpiece
Masterpiece.
dog shit, starting area is too big no help on progressing
balls
If you liked DS3 you'll like this one as well, since, in short: it is DS3 expanded. It is crazy how big it is, how many builds, weapons and pathways you can take. Be advised: if you want to beat every boss in a single run it'll be almost impossible, unless you do it with a guide.  Still, there is one downside to all of the virtues of this game: boss recycling. There must be around 15 bosses or so that will appear later on as a regular enemy, which is somewhat underwhelming.  BTW, try looking up any NPCs you may meet along the way, they'll probably have a quest that'll be in your interest to complete.

fire giant trash boss
it's AT LEAST pizdos
At the begining of the game i was a nobody who died to every enemy. At the end im a God who dies to every enemy. 10/10
Amazing game, only downside is performance, though in 2 or 3 years everyone will have strong enough hardware to run it so it's ok I guess. So yea... buy it. Would 101% recommend it :)
I saw a message. "Secret tunnel ahead", it told me. I jumped into the cave right in front of it.   There was no secret tunnel. Only fall damage.  I should have known better.
its hard  
Another great game from FromSoftware. True its niche in the sense it is harder and for more challenge seeking players. But ER eases on this with the open world and the chance to eventually become overleveled by exploring it. 10/10 would re-play again.
10/10 would recommend.
GOAT game that's all I can say beaten the game like 4-5 times now and still going 
very gud
its aight
casual version of dark soul.  but still be the great.
Awesome
Amazing game
awesome
I cant stop playing this game, so much to do and so much to discover
10/10
absolutely stunning
From one who never play any souls-franchise before, I finished this game with impression and really fun 100-hours.
Ledgendaring!
The GOAT Soulslike.

Such an amazing experience. Fluid combat, excellent boss designs, practically infinite replay-ability. Play this game.
fun
Developers should fix this game. I just lost my level 151 build and 80 hrs in this game to save game loading error when a sudden pc crash shut down  my pc. When i reloaded game this issue pops in. Tried every thing but nothing worked. Done with this game. Buy at your own risk.
Destined Death.
Haven't even finished the game yet and I love it. Masterpiece  EDIT - Finished it and it was amazing
Beautiful scenery and gameplay. Really enjoyed my first playthrough of the game and I definitely recommend it to others. Just bewary of doge
Very good game.
I can't believe how good this game was.
its, pretty good much good big good get or dont but is good eldenrinng be like 8.36421/11.231
I focused on levelling and getting good gear would highly recommend. :)
"May chaos take the world"
i killed the horse guy
TL;DR Overall 8/10. If you have not played any Souls-like titles before it's is a must-play. I will focus on the parts I didn't like in the review but there are a lot of good things as well. Level design, graphics and music are outstanding, 11/10. Boss fights: 3/10. Worst part of the game. Generally it's insanely unrealistic and stupid just for the sake of tricking a player. Bosses use their ultragigachad500kg hammers just like daggers, there is 0 sense of motion, inertia and weight. They can halt mid air, turn mid air and autoaim just to mess with your brain. If you have a melee weapon your tactics will be <roll> <roll> <roll> <hit> <roll> <roll> <roll><hit> almost for every past-mid-game boss, that's how they are designed to be `difficult`. It makes the fights unsatisfactory. Overall gameplay 6/10. Leveling up seems to be useless because every rat or naked hollow dude deals the same amount of damage as bosses no matter what armour you have. Perhaps the sewer rat should be the next Elden lord?  Killing mobs provide no rewards. Looting is a joke, because 99% of loot is trash. Since all weapons are kinda balanced you can finish the game with a weapon you have found in the first 10 hours, there is no much point in finding a new one stats-wise. Don't get me wrong, the game is good overall, especially if you have not played any DS title before, however for me the RPG and boss fights part was weak.
It's very easy, would recommend.
GOAT
Great Game!
The game's fine (and the whole saga) but definitely it's not for me (and if you're anything like me, probably you'll feel the same). Allow me to explain myself  Au contraire of many reviewers, I don't see Elden Ring as a 'masterpiece' nor a game superior in any way to an ultramodded version of Skyrim SE or AE. Sorry about that.  Nah, it's not about difficulty, you heathen bitch. I was able to overcome some initial bosses searching for tips here and there, it's about the gameplay itself: the entire world wants you dead, it's hostile, creepy, inhuman, inaccesible, hermetic and fucked up all around. It's exhausting and boring. Go there, be trashed aprox. 20-30 times by some weirdos before going forward. Repeat.  You wanna have some fun by overpowering your build? Let's do your research before playing: forums, videos, fan websites and the like. And I'm a sort of a'soft gamer' with a life and family, I don't want my time to be wasted before playing, I just wanna have some fun playing the damn game.   Besides, I need a game to be plural, 'human', diverse, colorful; I need a game to tell me a story, providing me a challenge I really want to overcome while I'm enjoying the sights, the landscape, the NPCs.. In Elder Ring I'm just shitting in my pants all the time. Not funny, you know.   Perhaps I'll give it a shot someday. For the time being, I'm gonna stick to my Witcher, my CP2077 and my ultramodded Skyrim SE. Enjoy this torture machiner... I mean, this game :)
Bloodbornes better :)
Bro, git gud and the maidens will come. 10/10

I hate it, but I can't stop playing...  Like Dark Souls, but bigger, better and badder.
jump.
very fun
for all you saying this game is hard, it's really not        all you have to do is roll
Fun to play even for SoulsLike  beginners as long u like tough challenges sometimes, but still many possibilities to make Boss fights easier. Definetly recommendable xD
So far so good, I guess
It's too hard.  But quite possibly the best feeling responsive and fun mechanics of any game ive ever played.  So just running around and dueling mobs is a top 10 gaming experience.  But, If you dont consider yourself a hardcore gamer, with like 3+ months to invest into daily methodical grind, then dont expect to get far very soon.  Maybe dont even try,  I would honestly not recommend this game to your dad or your grandpa,  or your friends that are not very in keen with gaming.  You need to be a pretty good gamer to play this game.   They really actually DO need to tone down on the difficulty just a smidgeon for it to be perfectly balanced.  When people ask if its really that hard?  yes,  it is really that hard and harder than that when you actually jump in and see for yourself.  But it is also very satisfying.  You will play for a while, and think, oh this isnt that hard.  Until it IS that hard.  And you will understand the depth we speak about when reviewing this game.  The map is massive.  It is actually too big.  There is never a point during the game where you actually have a good feel for where you are or where youre going.  its just too much.  Even when I have grinded this game out to absolute completion,  the map still is too much for me to fully grasp at times.  I remember thinking multiple times that I must be near completion of the game,  and then realizing that I have only revealed maybe 10% of the game.  And then after unvealing even further like 10x deeper than my original, I would start to think that the end must be in sight very soon.  And yet, it wasnt.  The end is so far beyond anything you could perceive,  that you need to set aside all thoughts of ever finishing the game,  and just hunker down and enjoy the process.  Dont look for an end.  Dont try to play it like you are trying to win right now.  The game is just too long to think that way.  Its ebven more massivbe than mmo's I have mastered in the past.  I think there is a line in the sand when it comes to difficulty and progression.  This is a balancing act where too hard and its a chore that isnt fun to do, too easy and you are bored.  They nailed it, while at the same time, completely crossing way over that line and stressing the user out way beyond reason.  And this title really does cross into that threshhold of being just a little bit way too much for reasonable gamers especially if you have any other commitments to attend to.  I am a hardcore gamer, with titles to my name and a vast experience in pvp.  It starts out and you basically just die, and die, and die.  When You start to get a hang of it.  The difficulty ramps up x10.   And then the difficulty goes even further.  You play for another 3 days nonstop, and then the difficulty progresses even further to a point that you couldnt even imagine when first getting through the initial skill cap.  playing through this game reminds me, of like a journey through a difficult career.  Where it never gets easier, it only ever gets harder the further you go,  only, you become accustom to the increases of difficulty.   You get used to the pain.  You think the game will eventually even out and become fair as you level up and gain skill,  but it never does.  The ground you walk on, goes from being mountains and hills,  to being on fire and ticking away your health.  And it doesnt tick just a little bit of HP,  it chunks out large portions of health non stop.  And it isnt as simple as just use a potion.  As some items are non recurring.  Meaning you get a dead set # and you have to find these items.  To turning into poison that kills you in 5 seconds, but you have to survive in it and fight some of the most difficult bosses and mobs for 3 hours somehow.  The biomes continually get harder, in ways you wouldnt even expect.  It's like the devs have an incredible talent for making punishing biomes for you to experience.  If it ever gets too hot, maybe go back to that first biome where its all green bushes and grass.  Because if you arent at least walking in fire and getting rolled up on by something that has an entire set of boss mechanics, consider yourself lucky because it will not last for long.  What kept me going, is that the game is just so fun.  I would not play for 2 days,  and then I just NEEDED to play this game,  because its just so, damn, fun.  I couldnt stop.  Even when I beat the game,  I ended up doing 200 more boss run fights of just the same 1 boss I liked, just to figure out all the ways to perfect him so I could show off my skills in cooperative play.  Even then,  most boss fights, you can play 1000 times and still never get just perfect.  You will still take a hit, or die in some unforseeable way. this very epic and hard boss.    It only ever gets way harder to the point where you are finessing mobs with absolute skill and perfection,  and yet you still die, reguardless of your perfect skills and mechanics mastery.  The game is designed to be able to kill you even if you are playing perfectly.  And at times you cant even believe that the game could get that much harder,  but then it does, every step of the way,  the levels get even more treacherous and difficult, and yet somehow, you will figure out a way through it.  There are some fights you can get through 1 shot.  There are some fights you can be clever and find a walk around or cheese method, or exploit.  And then there are some fights where your currect charcter build demands that you just hunker down, and learn the fight absolutely perfectly, and then hope you get one lucky go.  There are boss mechanics in the game, that actually really do cheat and dont make sense.  You can play it perfectly and still get an unlucky go, and die.   You will have to just die and die and die and maybe on the 10th or 15th time youll get through it.  its a LOT of fun, but you need guts, and time, if you have the guts, go for it.  There will probably never be another experience like it ever again.  10/10.  Right now I probably would not play another game like this again, simply because its just too much most of the time,  unless they made a game where you could actually stand a chance on your own without looking up guides.  I had a constant 5 to 20 tabs open on my windows for guides for the vast amount of things this game has that you need to do or figure out.  Its, a lot.  It's literally actually too much.  I would suggest they make the map like half the size next time also.  And maybe not be such a complex maze even when you are standing in a grass and hill biome, its just too confusing and too easy to get lost.  Like all you have to do is take a couple steps forward and you are lost and confused.  look to the left, you are lost,  look right, you are lost.  That is one part they could improve in future designs.  Take out a LOT of the complex hills and shrubbery, ect.  Sometimes you just get tired of battling in a never ending maze, and especially when the maze is the size of the actual universe irl.  with all this said,  you cant play this game and not have fun.  it's all about the mechanics, skills, spells, and weapons.  they are just so good.
Amazing Game
magnum opus
An absolute masterpiece.  When I first started playing it, I quit after a couple of hours. Being a "Soulslike" player since Demon Souls, the open world somehow didn't really spark my passion.  After talking to a friend I gave it another try with a more open minded approach and just explored the world in a more Skyrim like fashion. And what a great suprise this was.  The world is just amazing, on every corner there is another area to explore.  What I love the most about Elden Ring is that it is not "forcing" you to do a looooot of it's content. It's not the classic content rollercoaster ride. If you don't explore you will miss half (or even more) of the game and I think that is a real quality of an open world game.  I love everything about the game, I only feel like I will have a hard time finding a new game that will live up to this for quite a while 😖
Great!
Elden bing chilling
I am not good at hard games. This game can be incredibly frustrating.  However this game is incredibly rewarding when you succeed and with the open world i feel that the tools and opportunities are there to progress and grind at a steady pace even for someone not as good as me. There are also so many YouTube videos and guides which provide great help. With the new game + the longevity of this game for me at least is huge; providing for me great value for money.
This will be a necessity in your life.

Elder Men Fighting
i want to **** myself (edit: i no longer want to **** myself i beat the boss i was stuck on for 28 hours)
summoned a rat. fucked it. found a rat. fucked it. found a big rat. big fucked it. no rat boss. dark souls 2 did it better. killed malenia with rats.  4 rats out of 5. would fuck again
As a long-time fan of the Demon's, Dark Souls and Bloodborne series, this is a huge leap backwards and I'm left with a myriad of negative feelings on this. From its half-baked open-world, poor technical performance and it's constant recycling of bosses. The world is a half-realised bore-fest with barely any NPCs to encounter (ones I do find are not memorable in the least), oh and the bosses. Jesus are they awful. The constant reuses of the same bosses, over and over. I'm only 30 hours in and I must've fought about 7 of those goddamn gargoyles, all with the same copy-pasted movesets. I also remember when other Fromsoft entries had bosses  that were tough but FAIR. The bosses in ER are absolutely relentless, giving absolutely no room for openings. It's a battle of attrition of I hit, they hit. And those one-hit kills. Good god. FromSoft really needs to distinguish between difficult and cheap. The stutters and FPS drops are another thing. The game looks beautiful, I would expect no less from From Software's art department, sure. But from a pure technical level, it looks nowhere near as pretty, let's say, as Red Dead Redemption 2. Yet here I am fighting with constant stutters, FPS drops, while trying to dodgeroll, which require frame-precision. This is inexcusable.  So yeah, overall, one of the most disappointing games I've had the displeasure of playing. Not a bad game perse, but an incredibly disappointing one nontheless.
its good
masterpiece
I suck at this game.
I absolutely love the game! I love the lore, I love the visuals, I love the bosses, I love the items! Great game would recommend 10/10
Quite possibly THE best game I have ever played. Music/Art/Gameplay amazing.
im going to put the ring on my ding a ling when i finally get it
What an amazing game. Easily the best game of 2022. Wanna know why? Just play it.
Hard. Weird. Mysterious.

My roll is still on cooldown
As an older MMO and fantasy game player any mention of the souls games and their well known cranked up difficulty have scared me away. Don't get me wrong I love a harder game and if it's too easy I lose interest really quick. I knew a few people who played it and they told me just how great it was and I honestly just ignored it. Not until it made game of the year did my I feel some interest in the title. Maybe I was missing something here.. Well let me tell you..it's true. The game is pretty damn hard, especially the bosses. I'm talking throw my controller harder after 15-30 deaths. BUT Wow everyone was right. It is soo satisfying when you finally kill one of those epic mobs. I'm talking about jump out of your chair, swear at the dead mob, and shout holy s*%^! It's that moving. The world is incredible looking, the combat is just thrilling, the exploration seems to be never ending, dungeons and caves have you on the edge of your seat, the customization of weapon and character are rich, and I just can't get enough. If your like me and heard all of the horror stories of dying a lot, they're right. You will die and die and die but each time your learning. You're adapting. Soon it all feels natural..and then you'll die again haha.  At first I hated seeing all the messages around and the ghosts of other players. Now, I stop and read most as there's some good information about secrets you'd probably never find. There's also some that try to trick you.. usually the 20 blood stains all around let you in on the disaster that awaits. When I'm in some dark deep cave system and I a short glimpse of the  ghost of a player it now calms me and let's me know I'm not alone in this adventure. It's really pretty cool. Trust me, if you love a good RPG, and you love seeing locales and monsters that make you step back and go WOW that's awesome, Get this. You won't regret it.
Well worth it
i threw my horse off a cliff
maidenless
This was a lot of fun. I would rate Bloodborne higher, but not because Elden Ring is lacking anything but because of personal taste. Hope more people have fun with this game. I Platinumed it
''Finger but whole"  "Try Jumping'' "Try Attacking" "Is this Dog?"   Just like Elden Ring, the player base is just as vague, chaotic and deliberately cruel. Also masochistic and sadistic, because to truely enjoy any Souls/Ring titles, you must suffer and make suffer. 20/10, will be stepped on again and again until i hit NG +20
so good

My best friend helped me how to defeat the hardest bosses, WELP! @.@
.
This game is amazing, first game I've ever played to get all achievements without getting bored. I'm sure there're still some things I never found. If you like Dark Souls or are even interested in trying this game, do it.  There are of course some flaws. Even after multiple patches, performance on PC isn't ideal, but far from unplayable. On top of that some bosses get recycled a bit too often.  At the end of the day i'd have to give 9/10. Excellent game that makes me wonder as a newcomer what else the Soulsborne franchise has to offer.
Prepare to suffer
I like men and hot cheetos looking aliens
My review of Elden Ring is Melina holds your hand  10/10

Best game of 2022
Very fun and challenging!
Having never given any souls-like games a try, I finally decided to jump in with Elden Ring. With a deep, rich world full of lore, extremely compelling combat, and beautiful scenery, Elden Ring is an actual masterpiece and, in my opinion, is one of the greatest games ever made.
Absolutely excellent. Everything I'd want from an open world souls game and more. Everywhere you go is exciting because there's always a good loot to be found in any cave. Even if I didn't use 96% of it, just knowing I had a new weapon, spell, or shield was great. I'd frequently find something I collected a long time ago was worth trying. If a cave has gear you don't care about, it probably has upgrade materials in it, so it's almost never a wasted trip.  The summonable creatures is a great addition. Even if you don't need their help, just throwing out some wolves or demi humans at a small town of hostiles is fun!   The ash of war system might be my favorite addition to the souls formula. Being able to switch my weapons from heavy to bleed to sacred at a whim made me more incentivised to try different strategies compared to previous souls games. I mainly used Zweihander early game, but even after I switched to Ruins Greatsword/Guts Greatsword, I put sacred blade on Zwei for death birds and skeletons!  Definitely one of the best games I've played in a long time. Also, rune bears and Malenia are BS.
Long to ramp up to a decent level. You will get killed a lot.
This game is awesome
cool skyrim
Yes
Fun but challenging
gud

There's a jump button
amazing game
first time playing a fromsoftware game; really good first impression i enjoyed it thoroughly but i wouldn't recommend this if you're a casual player and don't have a lot of time to play a game. first off the map is HUGE, like i wouldn't be able to put in words on how big the map is, the best example i could give is the fact that when i first started playing and found my first map piece i thought "damn this game is pretty big" not taking into account the fact that the piece of the map i just got was the starter area and the only about 1/16th of the total game, maybe even less- so in short what im saying this is gonna be a pretty long review.   next thing i want to talk about are the bosses, this game would absolutely not be complete with the countless challenging (yet annoying) bosses, but i really appreciate the fact that the developers didn't make it so if you encounter a boss that you can't beat you have to spend hours, days, or even weeks trying to so you can progress in the story, but in elden ring you can actually just leave that area, go to a different area that you can manage and spend a couple hours there to get something that can beat the boss.   i'd say my two main complaints about this game are balancing, and how the sheer size of the game affects the story and all the things that you miss due to it.  the balancing:  again as much as i love this game and how it lets you deal with not being able to beat a boss i feel like dying in two hits or even one hit makes it so when you do spend your attempts with said boss trying to actually predict the move-set just to accidentally dodge the wrong way or dodge half a second late you feel like you've just been cheated out of finally beating the boss because of some stupid glitch despite it just being part of the game. this is a really easy problem to fix as all you have to do is go back to a few bosses and adjust the damage output on them, or the amount of health they have. i remember (SPOILERS AHEAD) when i first encountered maliketh there was a draconic tree sentinel in front of his boss room, i spent nearly an hour trying to defeat them, only to enter the boss room and kill maliketh in a few minutes, this is the kind of shit i talk about when i say "balancing issues".  pacing and guidance: now when i first started the game i remember accidentally roaming to the mid-game part of the map, to say the least i was vaporized the second i encountered an enemy, of course now its a walk in the park but back then it was like hell. the problem with this is the fact that the map is enormous and i spent hours just trying to get there since i didn't have torrent to travel, i didn't have torrent because the game didn't give me any hints on to where i should be going for it. talking to white mask varre and following the grace paths are the only decent guides you get at the start of the game and even if you figure that out those options barely work. for the rest of the game you're fated to just listen to the boring, bland dialogue of what to do or where to go not even knowing if you're supposed to listen to that advice due to you not understanding where to travel to next because of how incredibly vague the descriptions of your supposed path are made. i didn't even finish going to every map portion before i completed the entire game and was severely under-leveled for like half the main bosses because the game never gave me a clear path on what i should do next. the real only way you can experience this game at its fullest is looking up a basic guide on what order you should do things or asking a friend thats completed the game for instructions. i still barely understand the story and didn't even get a special ending to the game because i missed all the quest-lines for those endings  as much as this makes me seem like i despise the game it's still definitely a top 3 for me. i do still find my complaints valid but the experience i've had from this game is like no other, i never thought of getting it when it first came out but now that i have i don't regret it. again i wouldn't consider buying this game if you don't have a lot of free time because of how large it is but if you do decide to get it i'd first consult a friend that does have the game and ask them for guidance.  final rating: 9/10    
best game ever
however. you are maidenless
very good
Good
It gud
if you want to know whats like to want to kill yourself get this game 10/10 
it a rage game
.
hard but worth
Even having played through the game like six times, I still find something new with each run. It's easy enough to learn a path and make a broken character early, or just enjoy exploring around and taking in the scenery. Definitely would recommend.
Game of the Year for a reason.
Good game.
AWESOME GAME

yes
game hard
Loved the game. I can still understand that it's not perfect and not for everyone. Perfect ambientation, intresting story to be discovered piece by piece, hard enough. Fantastic boss designs even if some fights are not well balanced (especially in the catacombs). I think that's a solid 9.5/10 for an open world.
W game
I hate this game.
Arise now, ye Tarnished

I followed the story and only levelled as much as I needed to to beat the bosses that I got stuck on. This is my first From Software game and it's amazing. I beat the main game in 28 and a half hours, very little exploring. But i would recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge but wants the amazing feeling of beating a game that will punish you.
e
very  challenging and unforgiving of mistakes.  but beautiful graphic and smooth game play 
too ez im just him
It's challenging, it's long, it's a bit scary. Loving every minute

I laughed, I cried, I cried and cried again and again. I wanted to scream but I couldn't no matter how hard I tried, I could make no sound. The warmth of the sun is faded, the sound of the wind has been silenced. I can't scream, I can't plead, all that's left is the feeling of tears rolling down my cheeks. I can't scream.  9/10 they can have the other 1 when they release a DLC

Not the Best Game of The Year but the Best Game of All Time.
its aight

I came into this game thinking its going to a small 9 boss game that people love BUT HELL NO this has and is the best experience iv had that wasn't a sequel to a game
im balding playing this game but at the same time having fun.   truly a masterpiece!
Game Good . F@ck Godfrey - Maliket THE BEST SUCK MA D1CK SIMPS.
So in short, i suck. BUT for some strange reason...... i keep coming back for more
Elden Ring leaves me conflicted, it is a good game, no doubt about it, definitely deserves GOTY. But the thing is, after playing the Dark Souls trilogy, it just doesn't hit the same. At the start of the game, it didn't really grab me and I didn't find it all that enticing. But once I reached the middle of the game, I got intrigued. Questlines like that of the volcano manor, were very well written and I found myself caring for a lot more NPC's in the game than in Dark Souls. Then the end, it was just underwhelming, after beating [spoiler] Malenia [/spoiler] and feeling one the greatest satisfactions I've felt, the end bosses were just a let down and the ending left me indifferent.   [b]Furthermore:, some other smaller critiques I have:[/b] - Dual Boss fights, my god why so many. Slapping two enemies that are practically the same in one boss fight just doesn't work. - They really went all in on delayed attacks in this game my god, annoying! - Either the one of the hardest FromSoft games, or the easiest depending on what you limit yourself to. - Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the intricacy of some areas like [spoiler]Stormveil Castle[/spoiler] or [spoiler]the capital[/spoiler]  [b]The good:[/b] - Music 10/10 - Looks gorgeous - A lot more NPC's that actually matter and have an interesting questline. - Good sidequestlines! - The DS3 weapon art done right. - A lot more dynamics in your build through e.g MIxed Physicks, Rebirth and Ashes of War. - UI is defintely better than previous games. - The world is a lot more dynamic, espcially in dungeons were it sometimes felt like you were in liminal spaces. - The use of verticality in cities or castles in this game is amazing, the realization that I could just jump on a roof and explore an entire different part or route, took my breath away.  Overall Elden Ring is a good game, the middle part of the game is where all the meat will be found and I will remember it for that and not it's endgame. 8/10
the bast game I have played in a little bit.
best game ever
Good
Amazing game, flawless graphics, very few bugs, hundreds of hours of gameplay and weapons to use
Fun, difficult, and absolutely stunning visually.
very nice 
the best of the best
Amazing. Just goodness. I mean after actually sticking with Dark souls III I knew soulsborne was for me, but this just leveled up all my love for it. Even though you can recognize some poor models and textures, you will overlook them. Because all the flashy, lovely places, well visually designed bosses will make you forget. Audio design? Chills down the spine. After just turning the game on you are welcomed by the most epic track I have heard in a while. It is well-done soulsborne with some new techniques. Summons are an amazing addition to the game, spells and incantations are beautiful and impactful while not leaving the weapons behind. There are also way more options with PVP cause they added an arena in one of the updates. My biggest problem is the reuse of stuff. The world is big and pretty, but it got so huge, that it seems there was a problem with creating enough original mobs and bosses. It is common to fight bosses as normal mobs and vice versa. Another usual occurrence is fighting one boss multiple times (I killed that white fuck like 7 times in one playthrough). Overall it will hang high in my hall of fame.
I paid money to suffer, great game. 
Great game! Can recommend it to anyone that like those kind of games
Git Gud
I really enjoyed this game (PvE only), but there's a lot of hype and it isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a well-told and gripping story, characters you get attached to who develop through the game, and interesting quests, this IS NOT the game for that. If you're looking for a cool open world with beautiful scenery, minimal NPC interaction, a deep RPG system with lots of build flexibility, and super fun combat, this IS the game for that.   You can adjust the difficulty by over/under leveling; I was probably a bit over-leveled most of the time because I explored a lot, so I thought it was hard, but not as hard as many other games I've played. There's enough to do that you can save the tough parts for when you're overpowered, or you could choose to never level up and go for a no-hit run.  The Bad: Most of the quests and NPCs are boring, and some of the quests need to be completed before others for no obvious reason. This leads to some items being easily missed. The story itself is kind of interesting, but it isn't presented in a compelling way, so it's hard to care about the world or the people in it. This is compounded by the fact that there aren't really any towns, townsfolk, etc. to grow attached to. Finally, while for the most part the boss fights are awesome, there are one or two that are glitchy and/or tedious.  The Good: The world is beautiful, and the locations are interesting and varied. The combat is wonderful, and the RPG systems are deep and flexible. There are lots of viable builds, weapons, and spells that can make gameplay feel very different. After the second main area, you can respec more or less freely. Exploring the overworld and various dungeons is fun and rewarding. Your mount can double jump and is a good boy.  Overall, I loved this game, and it's one of my all-time favorites now. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a mechanically and aesthetically brilliant action RPG who doesn't care too much if the story and characters are a bit mediocre.
Game of the year over God of War Ragnorak for a reason.
The GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!!! If I ever regretted buying any game instantly, it is this catastrophe. Clunky, unintuitive controls, terrible aiming when you play as a mage, overpowering foes right at the start, terrible induction into the game - it's beyond me how this game could have ever gotten a positive review...no, no, no, not my cup of tea at all, never again! hell no!

Good game

ABSOLUTE FUCKING BANGER
Best game of 2022 and I was so busy playing this game I forgot to even leave a review!  Its a challenging fun game, my old pc turned every Mob invisible so my first 10 hours in this game where super hard!  I enjoyed even that so much I got myself a new pc lol!  If you have not picked this one up yet you are truly missing out, its worth full price and its worth getting a pc that lets you see what you are fighting.  Fun with friends although the strongest player can carry abit to hard so try and scale down a little to not ruin your friends first run.
goes hard
It is a great game.

great game recommend
Second time buying this game and it still hits. 
I wish there was less open world stuff and more stuff like Stormveil castle. The open world and the terrible optional dungeons don't feel as though they have the same care put into them that larger legacy dungeons do. For such a "large" game, it seems to have the same amount of content in it as Dark Souls 3, just spread out a lot further.   Hopefully more updates and DLCs come that round the game out and make things feel more complete. I can't really recommend it until that point.
very addictive and emersive love the open world and they graphics are amazing!
I died, I died, I died, I won, I died, I died, I died, I almost won, I died, I almost won, I died, I died.

I've never played a Souls-like game before. I'm a very casual gamer and figured this type of game was out of my wheelhouse. But I bit the bullet about a month ago and bought it and I now have almost 80 hours put into this game. It's hard, it's infuriating, and I've never wanted to chuck my laptop out a window before. But I can't stop playing. The open world is beautiful. It's an incredible feeling taking down a boss you've been stuck on for 20 or 30 tries. I finally understand why people love this game so much. It's incredible. If I'm gonna point out any problems I have..I wish there was a little more....structure or targeting to the story? It's kind of hard to follow along sometimes. And I also wish there was a comparison screen for equipment you're buying to the one you currently have on. But other than that it's amazing.
Solid singleplayer game. This author's dedication to crush any attempts at modification are disgusting, however.  I wanted to play Seamless coop with my brother. It is a mod that allows 2 players to play together, and explicitly cuts off the players from playing with people that don't have this mod. It worked for a couple of sessions, then the latest update completely deleted the executable to launch that.  So I tried to fix it, and it the anti-cheat somehow denies even administrator privileges.  The anti-cheat then completely broke my terminal when I tried to use that to play. I can't even launch my terminal anymore. It is actively breaking other things on my computer.  I have never made an attempt to play with anyone except my brother. I have never participated in an invasion, left behind a message, or anything. This is awful.  You want to know why this game will never have the cultural impact of Skyrim or Fallout? This is why.
ja ist gut
I've said FF7 was my all time favorite video game ever released all my life, until i played this game. An absolute gem. 10/10 would recommend.
reaching 500 hours of gameplay and possibly 500 more. would recommend.
this game beeg
Dog
hard like my cock
nice
I am addicted to this game so much!! I love playing it all the time..even when I am sleeping I am dreaming about this game. A plus!
got good
Beautiful scenery while dying.
Eldem rign
One of the best fromsoft games out there! It has the combact and difficulty of the souls games but it's combined with an open world adventure formula that has you completely involved in exploration along with countless retries fighting some boss xD  Regarding the difficulty of the game, i'd say it's pretty hard in early game, then it gets alot easier during the midgame as you get better gear and level up, finally there's some challenging bosses towards the endgame as well.
200 hours in, i am elden lord. may the frenzied flame lay waste to all spindles of gold, tethered to a time since past.
One of the most recent patches has rendered this game virtually unplayable, frame-rate, stuttering, etc.. Spent several hours trying to fix the issue, but not finding any options. There is an incredible game here, but the developers don't know how to make something work on PC.
Dog ahead
One of the best games ever

Sorcerer Rogier ♥
definitely not hard
Pretty decent for a victim simulator. There are several big big problems, though.  Foremost, there is absolutely no information in the game about any of the (side) missions - you have to rely on information got from NPCs only and this info they give you is severely lacking. It is literally impossible to do the missions without the help of our old pal internet, unless you are simply lucky with your actions in crucial situations or find out the next mission steps and locations by blind luck. The idea of the environment and NPCs telling you the story is refreshing and certainly a million times better way than Assassin's Creed-style IN YOUR FACE display of too much information, but in this game it is the other extreme - not getting enough basic information.  Secondly, the controls are simply utter shit. Console port in its worst possible meaning. Keyboard macros alleviate it a little, as does playing with a controller, but this should not be the default option for a PC game.  Thirdly, the bosses suddenly get unnecessarily tough compared to the previous gameplay.  Also, I do not understand the hype around the size of the map. It is big - yes, but not THAT big. You could drive your horse from one edge to another in a couple of minutes, the landscape permitting. What makes the feeling of the map bigger is the fact that it is artificially fractured by unpassable cliffs so that you have to go around via longer routes and hence the feeling of the map being bigger.  Also important - WTF with the limited 60 FPS? This crap must be fixed ASAP.
good game
I did it!!!
its a awsome challenge you can play in so many different ways
very cool
All the hats look dumb
hidden path ahead
This is so fucking boring. Give us DLC already or boss mode and try fingers but hole!  Edit: They actually went and did it! Miyazaki you absolute chad! Take my thumbs up "click".
this  game is really fucking good like 10/10
[h1] Depressing game for depressed people. [/h1] [u] Extremely overrated garbage with countless problems.  [/u] [b] Even though I fully completed the game with 100% achievements, I can't, with good conscience recommend this pile of horse$h1t to anyone... [/b] This was my last souls game. From Software needs to stop making such games with this painfully stupid game mechanics. This game design is awfully flawed in general.
Just beat the game. Don't wait for a discount. Get it now.
Yup.
The rotsussy hit differents
yes
mmmm
Best f... game I've played
Absolutely amazing 10/10 Must get game
I cant ever seem to finish this game. Still, the open world is filled with secrets and amazing, the lore is interesting if you can take the time to decipher it, the gameplay souls like but improved imo. Hard to go wrong as long as you arent afraid of a challenge. If you play with friends, consider downloading the "Seamless Co-op" mod. It makes playing online with friends so much more convienient.
This is the best game I've played in recent years.
guy with dragon arm, moon lady, star guy, moldy guy with cane, and angry wrestler. This the best game ever

THE EVER BRILLIANT ELDEN RING!!

Best game ive played in years
The best game I have ever played !! So much depth. Awesome lore . Great Story !
Standard open world game. Guidance around the open world is bad. Says to follow light as a form of guidance, takes me to a boss that skips 3-4 bosses. Asked an experienced friend to guide me who only found out what to do after exploring the entire map and finding where they needed to go (sometimes required youtube videos).   Lastly, the controls for this game were built for controller/pad. If you're a keyboard andy, this game is not for you chief. PC controls are super clunky and inefficient. I have to let go of my mouse to do a sequence of buttons to just do common things in the game.   
man i'm dead
Super fun and has a lot to explore. Can be tough at times, but insanely rewarding when you finally beat bosses that have been beating you up. All around, very beautiful fun game, with lots of replay value! Very deserving of Game of the Year! Highly Recommend!!!
Huge awesome open world.
awesome
ok don't be mad
This is the best game ever 
Try finger but hole
the game usually takes 2-3 tries to just launch ( 18/20times ) has to be force-quit most of the times ( 19/20 times ) random crashes when changing graphicsettings ( twice so far ) random infinite loading ( ~1/hour ) {edit} videosequences randomly not playing, locking bossfights/progress ( 03/10 times )  ( all numbers are estimates ) rather laggy, ( I can play similiar games with my PC and they don't lag that hard )  the rest is basically darksouls but openworld & easier  edit: so technically it's a mess but still fun gameplay ( if working ;) and interesting world to explore

i become eldornian lord and slay the slay slay slay (slay.)
I don't really know what to say. This game is a mixed bag for me.  On the one hand, I don't like this game. It's too big. The side dungeons/caves/catacombs are all half-baked and don't add much to the game. I feel the game is simultaneously too easy AND too hard. It suffers from a lack of focus and I think doesn't do a good job at making travelling from point to point interesting. Again, I really think the game is far too big. Remove the side content entirely and focus on making more legacy dungeon content/ actually interesting open-world engagements, and it'd be much, much better in my eyes.  On the other hand...  God. This game changed my life. I don't know what it is, but I find myself appreciating life more, appreciating the things I have, and have gained a deeper understanding of what I even look for in life. A bit dramatic, sure? But I'm a very emotional person. I can't really describe my feelings without turning this review into a dissertation, so I'll keep it brief. Elden Ring showed me that things are beautiful in spite of all the ugly things around it. And it taught me to appreciate what I have, and not to force things to be the same just because they feel good.  I love playing this game with my friends. The issues I have still exist, and I think the way that co-op is handled does not fit the nature of an open-world game. I prefer the Seamless Co-Op mod for this reason. I feel as if Seamless is the way the game is meant to be played as far as co-op goes (even if the Rot mechanic is stupid as fuck. The game is hard enough already.)  I dunno. I guess I recommend it? It would feel disingenuous to not recommend it after the effect it's had on me. I guess I should just say: Temper your expectations going in. Don't buy into the hype. Don't focus too much on what other people have to say. Just make it your own experience.
Frankly, easier than Bloodborne which I'd consider the easiest souls game besides DS3.
Mmm... good soup.
Try mods
Tl;dr:  Read a book or something. If you aren't a streamer or unemployed you wont have the time to play this game. Its size makes it a huge slog. Not a good introduction to the Souls Series and not a good continuation for returning players. If you enjoyed the bosses, you will be dissapointed, their moves are poorly telegraphed. If you enjoyed the multiplayer covenants, you will be dissapointed, covenants were removed, as were worthwhile multiplayer rewards. If you enjoyed the arena matchmaking from DS3's dlc you are in luck, it has made a return and since Elden Ring is relevant you will find arena matches. Go phone your parents or friends or go to a bar drinking, those will fullfill you more then elden ring will.  Rant start. Elden Ring expands and streamlines systems from previous games, while showhorning in crafting and an open world. The weapon infusion mechanic combined with the new ashes of war, that allow customisation of a weapons moveset, are great. The invasion multiplayer experience has been neutered, there are no more covenants. The cooperative experience has been streamlined, with a single item ones summon sign now appears all over the game world at certain unlocked summoning pools for other players to find. The rewards for any type of multiplayer? Nonexistant. Multiplayer rewards consist of the equivalent of a humanity/ human effigy/ ember and something called a furlfinger remedy, an item to reveal summon signs. The furlfinger remedy can also be crafted by mashing together two of the same flower that can be picked from any roadside. Elden Ring has seperated the boosting aspect of a humanity/ human effigy/ ember from the multiplayer enabling aspect. This results in two severely devalued items. The default reward for multiplayer has as such not changed from previous games, but the percieved value is much lower. The removal of covenants and their unique twist in multiplayer means there are no longer any covenant specific rewards, that could at least act as a trophy. The new open world itself is bloated, to much space, to little substantial reward for exploration. Most exploration rewards are now crafting materials in unsubstantial amounts. Heavy expendable item usage now demands farming for materials from monsters, or prancing around the world picking flowers. There are traders, but not all crafting materials are buyable in unlimited amounts. Want to toss a kilo ton of tnt worth of bombs? Have a fun time farming materials. Want to do a bow only run? Have fun killing small animals for their bones to craft arrows until you find the right merchant. Then farm even more to upgrade those arrows with different effects. Want to use more special arrows? Hit or miss if they are craftable/ buyable/ must be farmed.  The lock-on system is completely unusable. Not a large problem for melee builds, but anything using magic will quickly grow frustrated with the inability to properly focus a target in group fights and switch the lock-on target. Bosses are frantic and unpredictable. Their combat is intense, with every combo being able to chain into the next with little downtime. The boss ai has been 'improved' meaning some bosses can now read your inputs and toss a fireball into your face, if you go to heal. The combos themselves can also be incredibly dependant on your position with no clear stopping point, meaning that going for a swing from the wrong direction after the combo seemingly ended, can net the player an attack to the face. The percieved weight of a bosses attack can also vary wildly. Perhaps they start their combo with their weapon swinging so quickly that one is hardpressed to react on time, just to suddenly take an awkward pause mid-swing, catchin you off-guard. Elden Ring bosses can be described as experienced pvp players; they only use weapons with incredibly short startup animations, they are masters at input staggering and roll catching and they have deceptive attack ranges. But unlike another player they cannot be staggered in two hits. I can't remember where i heard this, but Elden Ring does indeed reward exploration instead of perceverance; exploring the bloated and empty game world eventually nets one enough levels and upgrade materials to overlevel any boss, allowing one to ignore the poorly telegraphed attacks of bosses  simply by the means of more healing resources and more damage. In previous games the bosses are consistent enough for the player to gather alot of experience with a bit of perceverance and use that perceverance to finally beat the boss. In Elden Ring the bosses have been 'polished' to such a degree, have recieved so much love in the form of varying movesets and combos, that i wished the animator in charge of telegraphing those attacks was forced to actually test them first. Being hit by the same high damage move over and over again, because the wind-up animation towards it has so little visual cues it might as well be a rythm game is not fun, its infuriating. Does this mean i am bad at the game? I would agree to that retort, if it weren't for the fact that every boss in this game has at least one such attack, an attack with a ridiculous pause mid swing. Every boss, with criminal consistency is guilty of this. Its either you overlevel the boss, or cheese him in some way, or you spend the rest of the year persevering through staggered animations that are meant to uproot any sense of movement coherency you might have learned over your whole life. The open world also quickly looses its novelty after you find another secret place only to be rewarded with a flower you could have just picked from the wayside in larger quantities. Towards the end i quickly rushed through every new area, because i knew that my time was better spent searching for anything worthwhile on the wiki and backtrack for it later. It was no longer a game, it was a chore i wanted to be more efficient to hopefully get to the good part. But there is no good part later. Perhaps the multiplayer could have been a major upside, but there are severe limits on playercount. The world is huge and the game is unable to fill it with either interesting secrets or wothwhile multiplayer.  Rant end.
Great game.  Pro's: It looks great. Nice soundtrack Decent controls Good story Decent replay value Hard It is a big semi-open world A huge amount of variety in combat styles and magic.  Con's: The story is hidden, and hard to figure out without help from a guide or video. Hard (it is both a pro and a con) The amount of variety in combat and magic can be overwhelming and confusing. The scale of the world can seem overwhelming.  All in all, it is a great game, but it requires a decent amount of dedication, if you want to get the full value out of your purchase.

God damn this game is good
it excellent
Good shit
I am not a big in to "Single player" games, i play MMO's and FPS, however this is the game that changed that. 10/10 can't recomend enough
fire game
,,FOUL TARNISHED, IN SEARCH OF THE ELDEN RING.“
Not as good as Sekiro.
fun
VERY NICE GAME 
Try finger, But whole.
the boss fights are really challenging but very rewarding dont give up u will beat it eventuallly
if you want to die buy game!
Best game of all time.
One of the best games I have played so far.  The map is full of secrets and challenges. Wherever you go you will find something. So make sure to discover every corner of the map. My first game completion took me 153 hours playtime, so its def. worth its money. Gonna start a second run right now.  10/10
THIS GAME IS MY VERY FIRST SOULS-LIKE GAME... And it is a very pleasant experience!  It takes me back to when I play Action RPG games back when I own PS2 console, and the hours I spent on them. Trying to get better, trying to remember pattern of boss fights, trying to grind your characters.  Many say that this game is hard, but yeah, to be fair, this game puts an emphasis on Field Exploring and Dungeon Grinding. Sure it makes you stronger by a certain bit, but it will make you better as well, in terms of dodging and parrying.  This game, well, it deserves GOTY title on 2022. Try it if you haven't yet.
great graphics
Peak fromsoftware
 😡
Does not support ultrawide without third party modification and only in single player
No hour-long sex scene between radagon and marika.
"The fallen leaves tell a story. Of how a tarnished became Elden Lord."  This game is what every souls player dreams of - a sprawling immaculate open world filled with hidden goodies and surprises at every corner with a wide variety of weapons and skills to wreck enemies with in addition to one of the best selection for fashion souls to date. And thus it pains me to say that some of the design choices made for certain bosses really sour what was a near perfect souls experience from start to finish. As compared to how sweet victory tasted when overcoming challenges in DS3 and Sekiro, here it feels that luck plays a big role and victory quickly turns into bitterness instead and for the first time in the series I've felt that I'm being punished by the game because I went with a pure strength build. DS3 is better/10
im too cold 🧊🥶
Trendsetter
Good game. Gave me anger issues but overall good game
Me like very much. very good game. difficult in beninging but when understand it not that hard
finally finished character selection, time for the real game. 
good game
you don't have the right, O you don't have the right therefore you don't have the right, O you don't have the right  10/10 beautiful game.
you die a lot
Here lies the Tarnished warrior, fought and killed several great foes like dragons, demigods, the owner of death itself, and a literal god only to end up dying to 4 rats in a sewer.
I am a longtime Soulsborne player so take that for what it is.   Elden Ring is a fantastic game, maybe my least favorite in the souls franchise, but still an amazing game.   For all the things I was excited about like the open world and crafting, I think that ended up taking away from some of the games charm, I never thought I would think something like this but I actually miss the somewhat linear setup of Dark Souls compared to the totally open Elden Ring - the open world becomes a little bit redundant when everything everywhere wants to just kill you (with one or two exceptions I think).   For someone new to the franchise, I would definitely start with elden ring as it has the most quality of life improvements, the game is fun and polished. With all of that said, I do wish that there were covenenants, and that the endings were fleshed out or expanded upon a little better rather than 4 of them being basically identical with a skybox palate change.
Dark Souls copied this game
Amazing game. It's an open world Soulsborne!
ok
A very relaxing experience
It won the game of the year 2022 and now i see it. DAMMM ITS SOO GOOD! BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS WITH EPIC FIGHTS AND OVERALL JUST PEAK!
this game save me from reality thank you for anyone that create this game,you save me and now im suffer to fight melania
Took 1 year to complete. Is good
easy game
damn good game
Great game
Great game by itself, so much to do and so much build variety but the coop availability is what brings it down so the seamless coop mod is a must for people looking to play this game with friends.
great game but very frustrating
Ruined other videogames for me. Not recommended.
sadness ahead..
bad pvp, as always.
W rizz
I've been stuck on maliketh for two weeks  10/10
If you don't like this game, you should play it more
so good
i hate game
Although the game has it's great moments, I find it's really not for me. I've tried many play-throughs with a variety of builds and they always work up to a certain point to where they just don't do anything. I level my character according to the weapon i'm using or the magic i'm using: faith based or Intelligence based, and it just gets to a point where I'm being one shot no matter what I use or wear. I fought a bunch of different bosses and can take hits from them, and live and then I'll fight a lesser enemy and get 1 tapped. It's infuriating! And with this game having way too many things stuffed into it, it's just not worth it for me to stick it out. I prefer the more linear-ness of past Souls games...I actually feel like I'm getting somewhere, instead of just roaming a big empty world.
I liked the difficulty and the variety of combat styles in the game
The best game in the world 
Elden Ring is like an onion, with layers upon layers of immersive gameplay, challenging combat, and rich lore. that will make you cry... tears of joy.
Gorilla man go slashy slashy. Kill these something something demoman gods from tf2 idk. Brazil simulator game due to accurate depictions of Brazil. Become a god of goliras. Ranni and Melina are definitely lovable sorts. W game made by developers that aren't apes like craptivsion and Infinity Ward :)))
This game is 100% worth it's price. The fighting mechanics are pretty fun and the lore just adds to it. You can verse bosses with your friends, or even fight them / other players. There is an offline and online mode and you can opt to help people by placing a golden summon, which is seen by everyone playing the game at the location you put it. When triggered allows you to teleport to their world and help them, usually fight a boss. There are passwords for this too if wanted.
meep meep     
Behold.. rump!
BRO.. ALL I GOTTA SAY....        IS DEFEATING EACH BOSS IN THIS GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME FEELS LIKE HOW I IMAGINE A GIRLS ORGASM FEELS LIKE!!  10/10 would suck on melina's tittiies again
Brave Tarnished, Thy Strength befits a Crown.
john elden
Bonkers, hard but freaking Awesome!
please add sex

very good very nice

Best single player game of all time
Sometimes the game can be a pain but you'll get used to that feeling believe me.
To have all my deaths and suffering in DS3 rewarded with what is essentially an open world DS is just a wish come true. This game is a no brainer for any DS fans and an absolute must-have for any RPG fans.
gg
gud
die get runes get stronger die repeat good game tho
its fire. what else is there to say that hasnt been said lol? game of the year.
This is the culmination of all the previous Souls titles, into one gigantic game that seems to have somehow fit the same amount of content and detail of previous titles into a game multiple times larger than them. there are hundreds of weapons, spells, armor sets, weapon arts and they all come together to offer more variety in builds and play styles than any other Fromsoft game. However, this is not without a few faults that this game has that cannot be overlooked. Because this game is gigantic, shortcuts had to be made when it comes to content like bosses and mini dungeons, so reused bosses and environments can be found. This can cause issues with the lore and immersion, as sometimes a boss can be found in an cave that doesn't make sense wielding a weapon it usually shouldn't. While previous titles had a couple re used bosses, such as dragonslayer armor, guardian ape, or the cleric beast, in Elden Ring, there are actually only a few bosses that are not re used. This can take away from the suspense of fighting some of the better bosses, such as Godfrey and Mohg, since you already had experience with another version before their real fight. The other flaw is the very strange variance in difficulty, especially in the late game. World enemies become harder than bosses, with gigantic health pools and often are in large groups, like the zamor warriors in the mountaintops or the banished knights in castle sol. This combined with the lack of meaningful rewards from these enemies can mean the best course will be simply running past them, which is not an ideal strategy in a game centered around combat. This is offset by the endgame boss guantlet, which is one of the best I've ever seen. All in all, while I highly, highly, highly recommend this game, I do not recommend it as your first fromsoft game. Dark Souls 3 is much more streamlined in its difficulty and is much more straightforward and easy to approach, as opposed to the sheer scale of Elden Ring which might scare some people away. If you  do want to push through and go into this game as your first, my best advice is to not give up and keep trying. If you're stuck at a boss or section, don't tunnel vision on that and instead go someplace else and check it out, find your own path that matches the difficulty experience you want, rather than what others may tell you to take.
Pain 
bruh its elden ring wtf u want me to tell u
🧰Treasure chest 👆 Precious Item ahead 👆liar ahead 👆liar ahead
Whilst difficult every encounter is very rewarding as well, the pure dopamine rush makes this game and all the other fromsoft soulsourne games. The rich lore is arguably the best in fromsofts catalog however it is hidden and personally i enjoy searching for it and reading all the item descriptions to squeeze out the full story
some dude forced me to play this game and i feel violated
is good
It good.
I wore Radahns' armor until the endgame out of respect so that he would have the last battles of his life by my side
Its a game that isnt going to hold your hand but rather grab your arm throw you then stomp your hand
Game made me so angry i "dropped" my controller so hard that it wont turn on 10/10
yes
This game Brings back the Childhood Excitement!!!
Haven't even beaten the game yet
bought this having never played a souls game before and assumed i would refund it in an hour.  i 100 percented it in 3 weeks.  miyazaki strikes again
10/10. Must play. I recommend.
Love from software and souls games and this is no different. A great souls adventure in a giant beautiful open world. Loot around every corner, Dungeons, Caves, NPC questlines, Secret undergrounds, World bosses, Dragons, Changing landscapes, Invasions, CO-OP and PVP whats not to love. Easily one of my favorite games ive ever played.
I put my foolish ambitions to rest after I started to play this game
WHOLE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU PLAY CO-OP
Made Godfrey my bitch
GOTY indeed, indeed
Best game ever
no Jueno 
if you like a hard game this is the game for you
Elden Ring... nothing else to say
FromSoftware refuses to publish their games on GeforceNOW. Yikes
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD
i spoke to the no maidens guy. he made me angry do a touched his pp and made him coom
its very good
dlc when
The game doesn't let me say slurs to minority players.
yes
I can't play it, but it's the best game ever made 11/10.
Crump
Takes effort, but good exploration and amazing visuals.
5 stars 10/10
I got this game when it first came out. I reached Stormveil (the first 'stronghold' area) while streaming to my friends (all of whom were super deep into the game already), and after getting lots of super in-depth tips from them, I rage quit after some bullshit (a friendly NPC steals your runes every time you die in his area, and I ended up going broke and losing all the souls I got from the 2 big previous bosses). After that, I uninstalled Elden Ring and didn't play it for a whole year. I thought about leaving a negative review for a while, because the experience I had first playing this game was dog shit, with too many secrets and too much emphasis on getting your time wasted fucking around and finding out.  A year later, I've dusted Elden Ring off to give it another try, except this time I played it my way. I didn't let anyone tell me what the "objectively best starting class" is, or take advice on what build to make, or which direction to go after I spawned. I just ran towards whichever horizon I wanted, killed what I met, ran away if I couldn't, looked up whatever guides I needed to to avoid wasting time with groundhog day-esque death-heavy puzzle segments. It was an entirely different experience, and said experience is the only way I can really recommend you play this game.   If you're going to play Elden Ring, do it the way you want to, and try to limit the number of outside voices telling you how you should be playing. There's a huge temptation to, just like in Tarkov, let Reddit-dwellers (or your friends in VC) do the thinking for you and tell you what you should be using for the most DPS or whatever - don't do this. Don't let elitist slimes tell you that you have to fight every boss head on either, or that you can't use summons, or that magic is 'gay', or that you shouldn't play any starting class besides the Samurai. Use however many quest guides or maps you feel you need, and just experience the fucking game with the features it has, in any combination that you want. If you're someone that gets frustrated when a seemingly meaningless decision causes something disastrous to happen, make sure to look up each NPC you meet to see if they're someone who's going to help or hinder you.  Oh and the story sucks, so stick to being impressed by visuals and cool weapons rather than by trying to make sense of all the dumb names and plotlines.
not good for mental heath 
best game
its good
This game makes want to violently void my bowels every second i play it  decent game 9/10
Goated ass game but the open world is huge gets you mentally exhausted sometimes
ez (i havent beat the first boss)
Very fun and exciting, keeps you on your toes and its not so hard after you learn the ropes. Overall arguably the best game I've ever played.
SUPER AMAZINGNISICITYISMNESS... great game very challenging amazing graphics and all around great game 
So good 
Great game for those who have time for grinding and levelling up. Splendid graphic, awesome (but slow) gameplay. Pretty fun, but isn't realistic enough for liking me.
PLAY NOW=
very good
Yes, just yes! The music is phenomenal and I cannot get enough of this
cringe
very good very nice it good game
yes
dogshit
Had to use the internet to learn unexplained game mechanics, and you can not pause in offline single player.
The world is open, therefore touch grass
This game is amazing as my first soouls game. Greatly recommend to others. There's no explanation as to why it can speak for itself.
lowkey a waste of money
This is the Dark Souls of FromSoft Games.
it sucks dont buy
Compra que é bom.
THE MEN are cute
Elden Ring is marketed as an Open-World RPG that doesn't focus on it's open nature, instead pretending to be Dark Souls 4 (with too much space). Enemies frequently do too much damage per hit, meaning that players should either go all-in on HP or not bother with the stat (focus on evading instead). This game still punishes casters (as DS3 did: no FP-regen, staggering stat sinks required, sacrifice healing for FP flasks, etc.) while getting rid of weapon durability (infinite melee). FromSoft is clearly too heavily invested in making a "harder" game (difficulty is always subjective) and failed to flesh out key details of this title. The questlines are convoluted and offer no guidance, even Majora's Mask (2000) included an in-game utility to track NPCs. The worst part for me was finding out after refund-eligibility expired that the game didn't live up to its hype and the first real boss can easily be more than 2 hours in. Now I'm stuck fighting a game I should be enjoying instead. C'est la vie!
Good game, feels bad getting killed 50 times... rewarding af when you finally nail it lol.
Game crashes constantly
Its a fun but hard game, it has lots of bosses an open world to fight other bosses that you don't have to beat. You can also always level up and get better weapons to get more damage and speed. Its a good game :).
Very good game!
good
strong foe ahead
best game i played ever!!
Good
great game, but we need a report button for invaders who cheat/hack.
why do people simp for ranni?
This was my first From Software Souls game and I absolutely did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. I have some gripes with it but overall this was one of the best RPGs I've ever played.  First, a few negatives; As my first Souls game I had no idea what I was doing for the first few hours of the game and I had to constantly rely on YouTube as my companion. The tutorial at the start of the game was pretty bare bones, I didn't even realise you could run until a few hours in.  The difficulty was extremely punishing at the start of the game. For returning players I imagine this isn't a problem as the mechanics transfer from previous games, but for me I had a hard time until a few YouTube videos taught me the basics. After you get over the initial hurdle you learn that the game rewards patience, it's all about learning the enemies attack patterns and punishing them when they show an opening.  Although the world itself is magnificent and the enemy variety and design were great, the game really sucks at telling a cohesive story. I had no idea what was going on and what my motivations were through a lot of the game. And my final complaint... no ultra wide support, that sucks on a game this big.  As negative as that all sounded, I still think this was one of the best games I've ever played. It's so satisfying learning the attack patterns of a boss and then trying again and again until you defeat them. The open world was huge and there was always something interesting to find. You'll constantly be sidetracked by branching pathways on your way to a destination.  The loot almost always felt rewarding, and even when I was deep into the game I was still finding new areas and mechanics. The ability to spec your character to whatever you preferred play style is great. The enemies were always interesting, some of the bosses had the coolest designs. The art and music were blended together perfectly.  I've completed the main story and I think I've been to every main area of the map but I'm sure there's still hours of content in the game for me should I choose to explore further. I'm glad I gave this game a chance. It won game of the year for a reason.
Elden ring is one of the best games ever made, but its not without its flaws, and some of them are serious ones (need for self nerfing if u want the game to be any challenge, weapon art spam, poor quality of endgame areas, lenght of the endgame etc) . Buy the game you will enjoy it, non of the above should discourage you from trying it out for urself as it is as genre defining as zelda botw, death stranding or likes of it. If you are looking for a game that pushes boundaries of what games can be, then you wont be disapointed, as this is truly next gen experience in many ways. That being said, its not a perfect game, but a strong foundation that gives hope for a future of gaming as a whole. 
dark souls continues
EPIC. The greatest adventure I've ever been on in a videogame.
This game is so amazingly cool and very easy.  Just summon a couple of guys and press L2 and you can almost always win. 
good
So much love and care was put into this game. So many different ways to enjoy it and make new experiences.   The lore is so deep, the way that VaatiVidya on youtube summarizes and explains it all is truly enthralling if anyone is interested in learning more.   Really nothing major I would like to critique, but I am REALLY hoping for more in a DLC soon.   10/10 for me.   
its for gamers with penis
It's elden ring. If you like souls like this is both great for people who have played through the darksouls series or even if this is your first souls like game. 
bleeed
hard but fun once gotten use to it
the best
best game ive played in a very long time!!!!
good game
I have more hours on this game, more like 60 at this point, I just play offline. This game is my favorite experience with anger games, I love it and hate it. Its a beauty of a game. Yes out of /10
yes
fun
The game is genuinely fun but when the first of the final two bosses just spams aoes and the second just runs away from you it just ruins the hole ending of the game
just play it already
I was one of the players, who a year ago gave up on this hardcore game. Now almost celebrating its first anniversary, I gave it a second chance, with more study of the game, looking at guides on the internet and taking it easy. I understand now why it was GOTY, great game, great atmosphere, RPG elements are really good. What a game!
best 2022 game  
it looks good but it plays terrible. some bosses are difficult just to be difficult no other purpose or game mechanic behind it. combat mechanics suck. huge bosses that dont fit the screen with attack patterns you cant even see. the end game boss was the worst boss ever. but it looks really nice. sekiro's combat better tho.
Screw this game, screw me, screw my life, 10/10 would recommend.
Very gud, very cheese, very tasty
Let me start by saying this: Yes this Game is really as good as everybody said it is. but I will start with my negatives. This world in some places feel too big for me. Many places you had to go long distances and some caves where just too big. Everything is a new area (we will come back to this later), even if you dont expect it to be. The Difficitly made me avoid this game for ages. Or like, I avoided every souls game. Even tho you can make it yourself easy in this game (Mimic Tear Summon / Co-op Bosses and more) it is still more challanging then many other games. and yeah the Map isnt really helping with navigating the Map.   the good part. I MY GOD I LOVE THIS GAME It felt like so many boxes where checked of, where other games just took the short toute. So many different Enemys, bosses, Places, People EVERYTHING The world is so insanly big (i said id come back on this) and it is filled to the top. It looks amazing and it feels even better. Often times I ran into a place with new and exiting enemys to fight and quests to do.  Often times when you ran into an encounter you could nor  (bc ur to bad lmao gg ez no re) or did not want to face you could just do something else, this was an amazing feeling. My first roadblock was the firt major Boss, or at least i thought so, I had two friends with me that kinda guided me through the game, and everytime i hit a "roudblock" they told me it was optional. There are places in this game entire dungeons optional. I tried to see everything and i saw maybe half  I really think you need help playing this game, either guides or friends tho. Often times my friends gave me a direction and I headed there, picked up a major Item w/o even noticing and in the end they told me it was a major Item (dec. medal for example) I would never have found them on my own tbh.  This game earned every praise it gets. I bought this game expecting an overrated but still great game, but no, it is not overrated and no, it is more then great.  God of war is Nothing lmao I see myself playing Eldenring for atleast 3 more times   Playthrough Time: 55h (did nearly everything) 100% Time: Give me a Moment
Fuck after playing this for days and going back to the older souls games it really shows how much of a difference being able to jumping makes lol
Cant stop playing
Try finger, but hole.
this game sucks
Perfectly balanced Masterpiece :D
Holy crap this game is not fun at all
2022 and no widesreen... wtf..
You are the difficulty. Massive open world with unlimited replayability. Well deserved GOTY.
Just get it.  A few controllers, and a minor dent in my wallet later. I learned I needed therapy for anger management before I returned to play more.  9.5/10
Ay yo this game is sicc, some areas reminded me of the first time I got lost in DS1  Also it's not too hard to get all of the achievements for if that's what you focus on
dog? 
game proves the following Graphic quality is not important, it's art direction Hand holding is bad for player enjoyment Game balance does not need constant tweaking  and more greatness
this game is a masterpiece every game could be replaced with elden ring and the world would become a perfect utopia
yes
dark souls but it fucking sucks
game of year what else can you say 
play with controller and then your gonna be here for 500 hours in limgrave straight and who cares about work school or whatever that is
This is probably the best game I've ever played. It's very challenging and I recommend using any tips or guides that you can find online.
yes

Got summoned by a Sephiroth cosplayer to kill Radhan

Do it for Ranni
First thing first, it was (and still) an incredible experience. I finished the game once with bleed. Moreover, I set off for more already (pure strength). The game is absolutely for the ones who accept it as it is rather than the others who do not comply with these game's mechanics. Nonetheless, those who aspires to learn the lore and experience the world may try to play as sorcerer.
best action RPG in recent years. must play AND complete at lest one time in your life time.
Bought it twice
praise the sun.....
Секс это конечно хорошо, но вы пробовали эту игру?
Elden Ring is about what you'd expect   It makes my want to jump off of a bridge so It is pretty fun
5,1 out of 5
get the game now
cool
Great Stuff!  Love the hidden stories  Love the world design  Love LOVE the exploration  Love LOVE LOVE the atmosphere and music!!!  As a Nioh Vet the combat in this game is serviceable.  Overall a 9.5/10 due to the repetitive nature of the combat-that being said I love the weapon and spell options!

This game is amazing, it took and implemented in an open world all the best mechanics from preovious souls games. I beat it twice: the first time like a coward, summoning NPCs and spirit ashes and trying to finish the game as quick as possible. The second time like a real gamer, without summons, and trying to explore everything, getting all the achievements as well.  "I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella." That was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a videogame because it forced me to "get good". And after beating her I felt empty and purpouseless, knowing that I couldn't face her again until a new run.  The lore is "beautifully sad" and interesting too, arousing the curiosity of the player. I hope the DLC will come out soon because I'd love to get some answers and new challanges.
I didn't need those hundred hours of my life anyways. Especially when 14 of them were spent getting my cheeks spread by a amputee who can use a sword good. 10/10 I don't if my family even still exists anymore.
dog
W Game it's fun with friends if you get the seamless coop mod. Nice graphics and music and spells and mostly everything. Should buy one of the best games i have played in a while
This game is trash
good
I have never played any souls game before, so when the game released back in the february it was beyond my interest, despite the huge hype around it. When Elden Ring became the game of the year, tired of trivial, repetitive rpgs, i've decided to give it a try.  Despite the fact that from the beginning bosses were wiping the floor with me i had such an amazing time playing this game. The Lands Between look stunning and are filled with places and things just waiting to be discovered. After optional tutorial we're being tossed into vast world with one goal but without any explanations. The way this goal is achieved is up to us - players. Each player will experience this game in a different way, depending on which places were visited and what decisions were made. Lack of markers on the map additionally encourages to explore the world instead of boring us with copy- paste question marks filling the world map. The combat system, despite its simplicity, is very enjoyable. The vastness of the available arsenal means that everyone will find weapons or spells that suit their play style. Atmosphere of a dark fantasy world is wonderful, well, as much as it can be, because the fate of the characters and the story itself is filled to the brim with pure despair and tragedy. I found the lore in Elden Ring to be very intriguing and it completely absorbed me. I was hungry to know the story behind the royal family, the fate of the descendants of Marica and Radagon that were shrouded in mystery. And revealing these mysteries provided me the most fun i had with video games for past few years. The graphics may not be the most beautiful but it doesn't matter when the game world is designed in such a beautiful way.  With a clear conscience, I recommend Elden Ring to any player who likes open-world games, which throw one challenge after another to test our skills.  10 outta 10... Producers of modern AAA games, watch and learn!
Bill Clinton loves this game.
Look, At this point you know why you're here. Play the damn game. Get good. Go into every boss fight with the words "hey honey, I'm back" and you'll be able to keep your sanity
wow
dont play, its live draining
Think of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but its flipping you off and handing you a dark souls mod
I'd smash Ranni idc how many frost procs it takes me to finish
best game ever. everything about it is just amazing!
SKILL ISSUE
I think there are definitely valid criticisms of this game but the depth of the lore, the amount and quality of content, and the reward of open world exploration this game provides exceeds most if not every game I've played.   It's worthy of the accolades and definitely is enjoyable to play with friends or on your own (I played my first playthrough entirely offline)  If you like action open world games that encourage and reward exploration this is a MUST PLAY!  Just remember to level your vigor to at least 40. otherwise you will have a bad time
dying 53 times before killing a boss is fun. 10/10 would recommend.
DUDE, Literally WWW game
Easier than Sekiro
Probably the best game ever made - Ghosty
itll take a little bit to get used to with understanding where you need to be in the game because of how interesting the game devs laid out the map but after some exploring and finding out what I want my strengths and weaknesses to be I am having a blast! Not only that I can play as whatever class i would like to without having to worry about "meta builds" or stupid stuff like that and can enjoy what i want. the story, artwork, and character creation was very well put together in my opinion. give it a shot i think you will enjoy it. 
very fun :D
Skyrim if it had dragons
Fantastic game.
The game is ok overall. The graphics and story are good. I like the fact that it is open world and gives a lot of room for exploring.   However I do believe it is a little off balance. Some bosses are extremely strong compared to the character, which makes the need for a lot of grinding to collect runes to increase the level. This is ok up to some point, but takes away a little the fun of the game.  
sarap mamatay
Fun game, horrid community, absolutely atrocious PVP. If you invade you are either going to get ganked or murdered by an overleveled phantom downscaled just to fuck your day up. Three of your hits are worth maybe one of a downscaled phantoms. Get it if you want to enjoy the PVE and COOP and the second you think you might want to try PVP just uninstall the game.  Only recommending the PVE.
I loved Sekiro, but this game just isn't hooking me. i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to be doing, and the i-frames on dodge roll are hard to understand. although i'm pretty sure that's just a *skill issue* on my part.

The only person willing to PLAY my maiden is a suicidal arsonist. Good game.
Like a Mortal Kombat adventure game with a interesting story (even if its rather difficult to follow)
oh yeah this game goes hard
This game is the best!!! I love it, it is worth 60 dollars!!!
Best game ever
9/10 Its good. Not as hard/brutal as other soul games. This could be attributed to the conveniences they added to make the journey more pleasant. Either way a fun game to play.  Easy to just sit back and get lost looking at the landscape. Got on sale, but recommend full price easy to anyone.
This is the best open world game, 90% of the other ones are dogshit
Still maidenless :(
This is the first FromSoft game I have ever played and I can say without a doubt that mama ain't raise no b****. This game has been beating my ass and in response, I am beating it back. I don't care how long it takes but i will make this game my B****. Rennala queen of the full moon..... I'm coming for that ass next.
gud
I put over 200 hours into a semi-single player game that routinely kicked my ass and made me yell obscenities at my computer screen. Half of the quest lines were so hard to figure out that I needed to use the wiki and lore channels just to understand where I should even go. Invasions are ridiculously difficult to pull off and spell spamming is rampant in the multiplayer scene. This game sucked away my social life, my sleep schedule, and was hard as hell.  I loved every second. 10/10. This game was the most fun I've had in years.
boep
31 hours and im so close to beating Solider of godrick, its really cool how a game is made just around that one boss and theres no other bosses :D
stud game
very good very nice
I am now maidenless 10/10
It's a great game, not the best of 2022 I think. I enjoyed playing it, but I won't recommend it to my friends because:  1. No side-quest tracking. Being constantly checking on game walktrough on websites or youtube videos, only to know what or where to do next, is simply irritating and exhausting. It makes me spend way much more time needed to complete the game and doing so exposed me to spoilers I didn't need to see.  I think it's a part of the marketing strategy from FS involving those youtubers to make such content, which I think is cruel to make your customer feel the way I feel (as mentioned above).  2. Multiplayer mode is so limited. "this game is meant to make u feel lonely, bla bla bla". Shut up. Just disable multiplayer mode for good then.  3. The late game felt anti climax.  4. The story telling sucks. I need to watch more youtube videos to know what's going on.  5. Tutorial isn't complete enough.
after 190 hours i can say game is good
good game
Bonk.
great game
Amazing.. I didn't think I was one for souls game but this game is much more than that and truly a wonderful experience that I fell in love with. The world is beautiful and there is almost always something new to see with its huge landscape and all the hidden areas. The gameplay is versatile and really lets the player have fun with it and choose his playstyle, you can play it slow and safe or rush to bosses it really is for everyone. It quickly became one of my favorite games of all time and I just have to give it a 10/10 must try.
First Soul's game and one of the best ever played games.
Love the game, but the co-op tag should have a disclaimer. This is not a co-op game. Many people buying this game thinking they can play co-op, finding out they will have meta mcghee forced down their throat to the extent you cant relax and enjoy with a friend or family member. For that reason I give it a negative review. Hopefully bringing attention to those co-op players that are considering this game.
fun af. good physics.
it's so a amazing game! when i first play it i whas so lost but thats not all it whas a compleate adventure for me cause there whas no point where to go so you are all on your one it's your story! wher do you begin first (golden knight XD) and where do you end i have 140 hours atm and still i din't explore all of it it's so a mazing map bosses mini bosses etc. the graphics are amazing! just a good old darksouls story only - thing is malenia but that you need to discover for yourself XD :)
College Graduate Simulator
This Game is Masterpiece !!!
Just a great game... Got beat up a lot  I've heard about finger maidens (I'm a lesbian now) Got a Honda Accord from Melina All animals are dogs Arson is accepted Got to marry a blue witch Katanas shoot blood or moon lol 
[h1] The GOTY. The GOAT. [/h1]  [b]The positives[/b]  An absolute masterpiece by fromsoft, there is no way to meme around it. This game builds upon everything Demon souls, DS 1 - 3 and other games have done and turns it up to 11. build variety, weapons, spells, incantations, all have been massively improved (so miracle builds are actually viable for once) to the point I cant think of any build in elden ring that ISNT viable.  all mainline bosses are amazing and most side bosses whilst reused a lot are also fun to fight. The story like other games is cryptic and the lore is hidden so using a wiki is recommended if you want to understand everything.   NPCs are varied and amazing (ranni being my number 1 stunnagirl). Summons are varied and fun (black knife tiche, mimic tear, cleanrot knight, etc.)  [hr][/hr]  [b]Downsides[/b]  However, on the downside the reuse of bosses around the map is VERY noticeable you'll find the tree sentinel in your bed at night, the crucible knight will shower with you. Its not as bad as it seems given they're usually fun to fight but It puts off exploration a lot when you know the boss is going to be a random field enemy but with 2x the health and 3x the damage.  On top of this the difficulty spike going into late game areas is very noticeable and it gives you a lingering thought that leyndell was meant to be longer or harder.  Bosses can be extremely easy and a lot of them have various cheeses (looking at you draconic tree sentinel) that takes the fun out of fighting them if you use them. Not to mention bleed is very heavily overused with other status effects being left in the dust (they did madness, death blight and sleep dirty).   There are currently 3 endings. Lord ending, frenzied flame, and the age of stars. the others are all reskins of the lord ending with various outcomes.   Melina is never used to her full potential aside from turning into bbq meat near the end or popping up in a cryptic cutscene and I never found myself truly caring for her from start to finish, I truly think they should've done more to tug at our heart strings to make Melina's death feel much more impactful.  [hr][/hr]   In conclusion the game is amazing even with its myriad of issues, and Id recommend anyone even souls newbies in giving it a shot. Just dont browse reddit and tell people you used spirit summons because the soultards will run to you screaming how you didnt complete the game properly because you didnt play as a lvl 1 wretch whilst undergoing a lobotomy.  Play as you wish to play, do whatever you want if it makes the game more fun and enjoyable for you go for it.   Bleed build? hell yeah cut margit into swiss cheese Comet azure spam? Hey I like DBZ too, annihilate them. Unga Bunga strength build? enjoy staggering the moon and punish every enemy in the game.  just have fun and enjoy this masterpiece of a fromsoft game
Probably one of the best game I've played in recent years, despite its extreme difficulty which made me almost give up on it one or two times. I love how massive the world is in this game, and how creatively diverse the enemies and bosses are, and usually I'm not a fan of open-world but ER takes the cake in making it feel alive and super interesting with many unique places.
good
VERY GOOD Do recommend  
one of those games that's really hard to just pick up and play if you're a new player, but the more gud you git the more fun the game is. never played a souls game prior to this and holy I am hooked.
tarnished the foul
trash
I am having so much fun with this game. So refreshing to be able to play an open world game that isn't giving me a new dot to collect every 2 seconds.
this game is really good at making you want to bash your skull in with a rock, but then you finally kill the boss and everythings ok because you get 5k runes and a dogshit faith sword that you cant even use because youre building intellect :) 9.6/10
hard and fun :D perfect fromsoftware.
fight boss , get killed by boss , rage and repeat

Amazing game
Pretty cool
NICE
Game constantly crashes on PC, no drive updates or disabling any windows settings/gamebar will fix it. Current specs: windows 11, EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 driver update 528.49 (02/08/2023), Ryzen 9 5900x
genuinely one of my favorite games of all time
best game ever
i'll tell you something about this game
This game is truly amazing. The open world is massive, the variety of weapons and armor is huge. Combat runs greatly, and the story is breathtaking. The only downside to this game is that it doesn't hold your hand at the beginning which makes it hard to get a good start. The side quests are a bit confusing but fun to do. I just finished my second play-thru and i would recommend this game to everyone reading this. Have a good day fellow Tarnished!

A world to get lost in
Just One Reason: Guard Counters!
it took me 10 hours to beat margit  10/10

mmmmmmmff elden ring mmmmmmmm
Pure pain and suffering, but sometimes also fun.
its good
good game
I live in Elden Ring instead of playing my life.
Everything that the souls series built is pretty much perfected here. Quite possibly some of the most fun mechanics/bosses in the series. 10/10
Very good game but only good for the first playthrough though, replayability is meh.. The first ng+ is the easiest playthrough you will have of any game ever created by mankind. Falling somewhere accidentally and having to run back is so much more bothersome since the enemies are all getting one-shot at this point and it becomes just plain ass boring and annoying if you somehow manage to fall and die somewhere without a checkpoint nearby, usually happens cause of how little focus you will need to run through NG+1. This kind of demotivated me to finish the game more than once.
One of the best games I have ever played.  The atmosphere, music, sound, and mechanics are so addictive. I don't really like souls games ( i did like bloodborne. )  There is just so much to do, see, so many unbelievably cool enemies, plenty of cool loot, awesome builds, amazing  character designs. The game is a master piece. It's all I will be playing for months to come. The mods make it even better on pc. I love this game so very much. You can spend countless hours in just limgrave. Yes there is a learning curve....i dropped this game for about a week because I didn't get it. After I got the hang of it, I can't play anything else right now lol
At first I hated this game, but once I got over the initial learning curve and start to figure out the game mechanics it got better and better. This game will piss you off like nothing else though. There are some seriously unfair boss battles in here, but the challenge is what makes it so fun and rewarding. It's the kind of game that will keep you engaged all day and make you forget that reality exists.
good 
a
I have never played a Dark Souls game before, but I have really enjoyed the time I have spent playing this version of a Souls game.  Bosses can be difficult, and after zero attempts at adapting my playstyle to each boss, I was eventually able to break through their defences.  Instrumental music is wonderful; I really enjoyed the strong beats in some of the boss's music, and the main theme was especially great.  It can be difficult to reach levels higher than 50, and some people use glitches to bypass this. However, you can eventually redistribute points and many bosses will give you plenty of rewards to compensate for the hard work.  I have not yet encountered the final boss, which I will not disclose, but so far the world exploration provides many bosses and enemies to fight when grinding for levels or acquiring various items of equipment such as shields so you will never lack in constructing the ideal loadout.  Overall, it's a great game, although there are some bugs that need to be fixed. I highly recommend Elden Ring for anyone looking to get into a Souls-like game with a great difficulty level for newcomers wanting to dip their toes into the franchise. 
The most worthy project of the master Miyazaki. A lot has already been said, just worthy. 10/10
I would like to play MMO made by FromSoftware Dewelopers
Free
Try fingers but hole
best game ever made
Good Game
An excellent game that warmed me to up to the souls-like genre. The exploration of the open world is very satisfying and the combat is challenging but fair. After 200 hours, I can say that not understanding the story at all did not dampen my enjoyment of the game.
dog shit pvp 
Moon wife
Mighty open world game which doesn't hold your hand and you are free to explore to your hearts content; something AAA studios fail to make properly, looking mostly at you Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda etc...  Combat is fun and amazing, especially levelling up and experimenting with various builds and weapons.  Game runs great on pc now, only got a few frame drops in some sections of the game, but wasn't anything major. Sound design is great, bosses are a major challenge to play against and it's just a fun game so go buy it. I'm on my second playthrough now.  9.5/10  Also Maleina is not the hardest boss in the game, idk what everyone is smoking...
Simply The Best. <3
damn good
boom shakalaka
moon mommy
God of War stood no chance.
One of the best games ever made. The world is breathtaking and the overall feel of the game is special
Such a great game. Pretty and wellpolished. If you like souls born games, this game is worth your time. I am playing my first blind playthough and can't wait for my secound playthrough.
yayyy
i hate ants
Pog game
I have journeyed far and wide, seen the lowest valleys, climbed the highest mountains, fought Demi-gods and beasts, and rubbed Two Finger's hairy knuckles, But in the end, it was all for naught for I shall always be Maidenless.
punched god and married a blue lady 11/10 highly recommended
Fun
the best no
A masterpiece changes the taste.
it's the best game i ever play, i would recommend it
Just a good great time, you can relax, with a sword in your stomach.  You can see great views, with a sword in your stomach.  Take a leisurely stroll through wild lands, with a sword in your stomach.  over all ill give it a sword in your stomach kind of game.
multiplayer is garbage. single player fun
Its peak.
Hard game, if you suck dont buy it
my gf gave me head while i tried to beat the first boss 3/10, would recommend to everyone
Very` khat' mau'
doesn't do my calculus homework  good game tho
good game and very fun open world
I don't think i will ever beat this game
Some of the greatest lore, world-building, art, music, and game design that we've ever seen. This game pulled me in and was all I could think about for a month. Also, I have a deep burning hatred and personal vendetta against some of the bosses now.
Very difficult but there is always a way to succeed if you pay attention and git gud
.
Too hard
Just beat my 4th run through, and I still haven't gotten everything! Tons of replay value, deep lore, and just an insanely fun rpg beat-em-up experience.  Can't wait for the DLC!
My most crippling addiction
This was my first time putting my fingers on a souls game EVER and I have to say I might be playing ALOT more, I had a week where all I was doing was playing this game and I was in a trance every second of playing it  Finding this game and seeing all the hype about it coming from someone who has never played a souls-like game ever had me questioning whether or not it was actually good, I've seen SO MANY people online say that this and any other Dark Souls games where the best games ever made hands down, you could see why I would question that, but after playing this game for a while and it still seeming like I haven't even touched half of the games content, I can confidently say that Elden Ring is By FAR my favorite game   
Malenia = easy
its alright
Phenomenal game. Music, story, atmosphere, controls are all fantastic.
Yes.
Best introduction into a souls like game. Would highly recommend for players looking to get into Souls games
game of the year!
One of the best games I've ever played. Everything about it is perfect. Got it as a Christmas gift and it was one of the best gifts I've ever received.
Good game

Yes
wiga 
skill required: git gud
Good stuff
this shit sucks a ass
the game was too easy
good yes indeed nice
goated
the most open world and story driven game i have ever played. i know people that have well over 600 hours put into the game and they still have much more left to discover
Like Monster Hunter, it's just another shit japanese game disguising boomer game design as part of it's 'core features'.   But somehow that alone made Ubisoft devs seethe and cope HARD on social media. And ANYTHING that solicits that much of a meme response from french-canadians is perfectly fine in my books.
I really enjoy how the game is difficult however it's not unfair. If you're stuck on a boss there's plenty of things you can do to level up or just have fun instead of fighting them. I also like how you can make unique builds.
A solid entry in the FromSoftware catalog that mixes the soulslike genre with a beautiful open world.
RAGHHHHHHHHHH
very fun fantasy game
quite good tbh
Rat. 10/10
fye
Pretty good game. A must play.
big bosses go hard 
big sword go whooosh
I was talked into buying this game. This game is like Inception. You're cool if you "enjoy" this. On top of that, graphics on the N64 looked better than this. This game is absolutely garbage and I would refund it if I could.
Best game
This is the best game I've ever played. Powerstancing katanas with bleed buildup is the way to go
It's good. A bit too easy.
GG
Fuck. Yes.
semi difficult and without much direction, but a good open world game,
Try Fingers But hole
the mechanics of the game is fun ,but there are also hidden mechanics and builds that help out your play style and it is a very enjoyable game
It's Elden Ring! What else can I say...
fire

Yeah dude, it's Elden Ring. It's good.
Cool game, man.
good game

spooooooooooooo gusd
i went back and played every dark souls game after this masterpiece. 11/10 on the entire series, it's my favorite ever now :)
I am bad at videogames, but i do love over leveling and blowing enemies out of the water with sorceries
Try finger,  But hole
Its an awesome game if u want too lose all free time u have
ye
Wow just wow..... after 120 painful yet amazing hours i finally have all the trophies for this game. elden ring is a true masterpiece that i recommend to everyone it is difficult yet the story is so perfect and hooking that you will not want to stop playing. It is the best open world game i have ever played and there is so much more that i could still explore. Top 3 game i have ever played everyone should experience it.
I loved this game so much, it has been one of the few games that I have achieved everything and enjoyed every moment of it. The story building that doesn't hold your hand to tell you a tale or being a game that handholds you to different objectives, the game is a masterpiece that should be on the play list for anyone to experience at least once. Can't wait to see more come to this game and what could be next for it.
I like this game, but I can't recommend it based on the design and balance.  Quite simply put: You must dump most of your points into Vigor, or suffer getting oneshot by most enemies and bosses with their normal attacks.  Worst of all is the Crucible Knights. They are designed in the most frustrating way possible in that they are entirely built to counter any tactic a player can use against them. You can't backstab them, you can't status effect them. Their AI reacts to everything you do to prevent you from hurting them. They have way way too much health that you just have to whittle down for ages while they're capable of one-hitting you unless you dumped all your points into Vigor, which makes them only 2-3 hit you. Which isn't fun.  It's not that it's hard. I've 100%'d Sekiro, beating the Mortal Gauntlet and other challenges in it with little trouble. I'm planning on doing the same Charmless+Demon Bell at some point. Not to prove I'm "gud." Not because it's "hard." It's because it's compelling to do so. Because I have FUN with it. Because I ENJOY MYSELF doing it.  Elden Ring's "to heck with your "build" just dump all your points into health or die" design isn't enjoyable or fun or engaging for me. It's frustrating.  TL;DR: Please stop making small enemies who can start a grab animation during the middle of my attack animation and instantly kill me.
probably the most fun game in years. even if you're terrible at soulsborne or souls-like games, the rush you get when fighting a boss or finding out incredible things about the massively expansive lore is incredible. i highly recommend this game for everyone.. unless you're easily raged
Dark souls but open :)
I haven't beaten Margit yet hopeful edit soon
Gud gam 10/10
unfinished game. may be different on the consoles but for pc its basically an unfinished critter slasher game. story content is weak. no journal. no critter display upon selection (there's a blank blue icon top left with health bar but no info).  I did take several classes to approx lvl 50 to get a feel for how they were set up and had the most enjoyment from a wretch dex/int build or dex/ faith.  But at a certain point its just about running around for hours killing the same critters for coin to purchase your next level. managed to kill the first boss with a vagabond (knight)  I just put straight strength attribute into and it was very anti-climatic. Plus they have all these ghost images of other players in "other worlds" (which i''m sure is just them trying to reduce their server load), that is very annoying. I can't seem to turn it off but those images seem to be random and sometimes it gets in your view when battling groups of critters. oh and the targeting absolutely sux. you can have a target locked and just as you go to shoot it again the target lock breaks and moves to another critter not anywhere near you. I've had my character do a 360 in place trying to hit a new target lock on some critter 50 ft away. can not tell you how many times this has killed me. tried shutting it off in settings but it doesn't seem to make a difference. still needs work, but i'm sure now that this has been selected as game of the year that won't happen as the public has set their standards quite low. Also this isn't a traditional MMORPG in the sense that you'll be exploring with the other masses. basically you play on your own unless you want to join the PVP server, or you wish to have a few friends log in together with you, but i havn't tried that as it just does'nt "feel" right..visually its very attractive, and probably what carried it through the voting process, but in terms of playing an online MMORPG I'd spend your money somewhere else. However.. It goes without saying the maps are wonderful. the castle have a ton of variety and theres loads of "stuff" for you obessive compusive folk..but sadlky for me it just wasn't what I was expecting. there has been several times i have stopped and wondered what I was supposed to do next (other than run over to that same mob and slash em again)... I've only been playing about 2 weeks (now about a month)  and already i'm at a point of deleting the program, or face hours of the same...the same...the same...the same...the same..
VEDY NICE GAME
It has a nice ring to it.
A game that manages to be more grandoise than most, if not all of the interactable AAA showpieces presented as video games, while feeling like a proper video game through and through. There's seldom a compelling reason to not play it.
pretty cool
It's like Skyrim, but you can't ride the dragons.
game
Easily the best souls game. Also Fia best girl
GOTY
it good and it make me get good
sa
very good game, great visuals and boss fights
Very stressfull yet hypnotic  VR mod by Luke Ross works exceptionally well btw.
Designers of Malenia, hit me up, i wanna smoke some of that juicy stuff you guys were on when designing her.  (I will change to positive when i get the goods)
Game of the Year

i do not recommend as your first soulsborne game but it is a tremendous deal of fun and its a gorgeous game.

Frustrating?Yes.  Masterpiece?Yes.
A really awesome game. Amazing lore so far e great map design.

Great game i have dedicated my soul to playing this game and dont regret a single hour put into it!

best foul tarnished simulator I've ever played
Game is great
Put those foolish indecisive thoughts to rest, buy the game.
''pure brainfuck''
This game shall have my babies
Git gud all over again.
idk its fun
Quite possibly From Soft's magnum opus (at least to date). Elden Ring is a modern masterpiece
I like the part with the ring
i am a holy man !
At the end of the day this game is great. Truly. People may complain about the small things, but for AAA games these days, this game really challenges the lazy norm.   I've played this game a lot. From trying to speed-run, doing "challenge" runs, randomizers, or even watching my mate playing as the "Rump Shaker", I've found this game has a lot of replay-ability and content that can be enjoyed. Hell, i'm trying to replicate my first run again with my latest character. I often pine on the 10 character limit.  Dungeons have garnered a lot of ire, with people complaining about the copy pasta-esque nature. I agree, they get grating, and all for a funny hat or talisman. But not all. Some of the cooler dungeons have a unique weapon like the "Ringed Finger" or "Golden Epitaph." But you don't need to explore, if you don't want to. The main 'Souls-type' areas are always a treat, with areas that are as densely designed. It lacks a sense of interconnections with shortcuts and secret paths of Dark Souls 1, but trumps the entire series in the area's individual design.  Combat is fresh and new, with the flashy weapon arts making a return from Dark Souls 3. This time, they can actually be used, for the most part. The weapon designs are new, fresh, and welcome. Dual wielding support is here, but classic sword and board can be just as fun, as shields have gotten a lot of love. Combat can feel a bit jank at times, with a tighter dodge window and many (MANY) AOE attacks, but once you understand the boss, truly, it is never quite unfair. All the main story bosses are a spectacle, and quite a good roster to add to the Soulsborne bosses.  Exploration is a big thing in the game. You can make most bosses a joke with the correct set up. Some may call you scummy, but the game is as hard as you make it. The only thing I can get angry at, is the amount of farming for some rare-er consumables. It's either something you can find under every rock, or a limited resource with a 4% drop rate.   I never interact fully with the multiplayer. I did a short session, and it seemed functional enough. They incorporate some multiplayer aspects in certain boss-fights, but never in a way that is truly jarring. It's always interesting. I only wish Co-Op was fully fleshed out with no PvP, but it seems there are already mods for that.  Overall, it is a great game. Not for everyone, by a long shot. They tried to brand out to a casual audience a bit more, but it's still a souls game. If someone is telling you to buy this game, I would not buy it. You're probably going to get bored, and give up, a couple hours in. If you take this as a challenge to finish and beat the game, that's awesome. But most people I've suggested to play this game, have given up, got bored, or just couldn't. Only one person really stuck through, and that was with my direct encouragement.  Play this game if you have a desire, and drive to play it. To explore the lands between. Or maybe if you just want to see Godfrey, Chad of the Badlands.
this game is the best.
10/10. Best From Software game and best game I've ever played.
Really should've bought this game (and my desktop computer) earlier...
Yes its hard that's the point of games, to challenge you...
AWS0ME GAME
ujftydctyhkkcghjcgh
Amazing game with an amazing setting. Had an amazing time exploring this world and can't wait for the DLC. Wish the performance/optimization was better.
Amazing Souls game. What can you say more. Just try it and you will see.
Okay first, I will say I would recommend this game to others. I think its an incredibly made game and lived up to the hype it had for so long. The reason I'm giving it a negative review is to let people know why it hasn't grabbed me the way other fromsoft games have in the past. Two things: 1. The open world is incredible but isn't my speed and I get lost and bored after awhile. The world is incredible, just open world isn't what I'm looking for in a fromsoft game. 2. After playing this game I realized the reason I like bloodborne and sekiro so much is they have unique and addicting combat mechanics thataren't present in the souls series and elden ring. So if either of those things sound like they'd be an issue I'd hold off or wait for a sale, but if it really seems like a game you'd like, get it cause it probably is and it's incredibly well made.
Good game.  Disgusting pasted on Black Bars for anyone on a wide monitor. Game RENDERS FOR ULTRAWIDE, then adds black bars for whatever reason. Anyways, absolutely disgustingly lazy.
Really cool game. The build variety is immense and I keep learning new stuff about the game every day. If you've never given any fromsoft game a shot you definitely should.
This game changed my view on the gaming world. I have played countless games, put so much time into a lot of games and yet I never experienced anything like Elden Ring. I have never played a souls game before Elden Ring and now I want to play them all. This game was a long 2 month journey towards that 100% and it is now over. I know there is NG+ and PVP but nothing will ever come close to that first full play-through. I encourage you to step out of your gaming comfort zone and try Elden Ring, for it will be an experience like no other.  Thank You, to my friend GarlicBread for the recommendation.  My Elden Ring journey has come to a close (for now), are you willing to start yours?  10/10
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Good luck and just don't give up for you are up to something awesome.
Having finished Elden Ring I gotta say that its so easy compared to Smithworks.
Commander Niall can suck my Commander Balls. Nevertheless an amazing game, I give it a pontiff out of gael. 9.5/10
Left my gf and became maidenless. 10/10.
I would recommend this game for most people, it is beautul and sad.  Well Done.  The gameplay however is much to one-sided especially for an older player, such as myself (77) and not allowing a easy play mode really limits the people who can really play and most of all ENJOY this game.  Balance is also important it's a little daunting to have everything thrown at you in tunnels but, mainly just an easy mode would be nice for some of us older people.  So as is I would  not recommend this game for myself, but would for younger adults, who can remember every bosses moves and abilities  Thank You for allowing me to express my opinion.
It's so painfully magnificent.
I bought this game about a year ago, i can say with no hesitation that this is the best game I have ever played. There is so much to do and the combat is something else. 10/10 GAME
very nice
nice
cool shit
The graphics are the most stunning thing I've seen in video game history.  Not only that, everything you see, you can go to.  Let me say that again:  EVERYTHING you SEE, you CAN go to!  This is the true 100% open world experience you've been dreaming of.  All transition between sitting down at "bonfires" and conversations with npc's are completely seamless, which adds to the feel of open world and like the adventure is a single continuous experience.  Sound design is god tier.  Voice acting is perfect, extremely fitting for the setting of the game.  Music is very well done to immerse and leave you feeling just on the edge of cautious, as well as create openings in the track to transform into boss music at a moment's notice xD  I have watched much of dark souls gameplay, bu this is my first DS game I've actually played.  The combat is fantastic, and the challenges are the best combination of tough but fair, and if not fair, once overcome, definitely rewarded.  I'm sure as I play more I will find that many of the different weapon options are exciting and balanced in their own way (tho I chose to play the big sword boi route).  I love the message leaving system, and I love that you can turn it off.
It's very hard but good. No maidens?
guud geam 
kai is shit at the game lmao
I have not seen my family in days and all my friends dont talk to me anymore. 10/10

BEST GAME
Best game ever made
pros: gameplay is incredible. its the newest dark souls game.  cons: new game plus is wayyy too easy erases summon locations in new game plus fighting same bosses in different forms multiple times instead of a new boss story is flat and uninteresting not enough weapons with unique weapon arts no option to visually remove helmet when i expect an epic scene, the movies always disappoint  
Modern classic
so cool game thumbs up from me :))))))))))))
It's really everything they say it is.
What I liked most about the game was the level of exploration. The game is way bigger than what you imagine on first impression and that first impression lasts. Elden Ring is one of the best open worlds I've ever seen in a video game. The game is tricky like all FromSoft games, but if that intimidates you I'd recommend looking up good starter builds online so that your start doesn't need to be more overwhelming than it needs to be. It won GOTY for a reason, i'll probably do a replay very soon.
I am surprised that it took so long for me to write a review for this game.  This game is really good, not beginner friendly, but it released a new-found love for gaming again.  It made me experience all emotions, from despair to anguish to self-doubt, which made me at my lowest, and as Buster Moon said: when you are at your lowest, the only way is up, and indeed it is up.  This game is truly a masterpiece, would gladly give anything to experience it first hand again.
Beautiful game. Hoping for a DLC really soon.
Elden ring is very good, just don’t look up any help for at least the first 60hrs, after that, it’s fine to go do everything you missed, mapgenie is a good tool for that. I’m bad at pvp, so that is lower rated than pve.
Yes, this game is hard. But there are so many options and ways to approach a situation that can make it easier; summons, comet azur, katanas (moonveil is still op). So don't let the difficulty keep you away.   I haven't had so many "holy cow" moments since I was a kid; the number of times I found something incredible, a boss did something insane, or the map just kept getting BIGGER. There is close to 200 hours of content  without even approaching new game +, and replayability is great because of the number of builds, weapons, spells, etc that you can try.   Reworking your build is a lot easier than before, and every area is packed with so many talismans and weapons you can try out with tons of different weapon move sets. Not to mention co-op play on areas and bosses adds to the fun.   Quest lines are a little annoying to track, but it's fun to hunt down and find NPCs, and a good portion of the quest lines have awesome rewards, or just unlock ENTIRE areas and bosses.  Don't miss out; please play this game. It's the best game I've ever played and without a doubt worth the $60.
As someone who has Dark Souls as their 2nd all time favorite franchise (Right behind The Elder Scrolls), I gotta say this one ain't great.  I don't actually wanna vote for not recommending the game, but it's the only option besides the "thumbs up" button.  Overall the game just feels hollow compared to it's predecessors. Pun only slightly intended.  The switch to open world seems to take away more than it adds. Seemingly just adding a longer travel time between areas that you would traverse in previous games.  Everything is even more obscure, and that's saying something for this series. Whereas the more "metroid-vania" structure of previous titles would make it easier to stumble across items and such, the open world aspect here basically makes having a wiki tab open in the background a necessity if you hope to actually find anything, or even go the right direction for story progress.  Actually, I can't help but picture the Souls formula used here as an old and tired Bilbo Baggins: "I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread."  Overall, if you've played the previous games, go ahead with this one. But maybe get it on sale instead of full price. Maybe around $30 max.   But if you're just starting with this series, go back and play Dark Souls 1-3 instead. Then come back to this later if you're desperate for more punishment.
If you like a challenge and can commit a little bit you will love this. Wouldnt recommend watching many tutorials as you should find your own thing and something that suits you.The map is beyond massive and many different paths to take like sorcerer warrior and such.My first souls game and as soon as I beat the second boss and got over how hard it was I fell in love.Would recommend!
this game is complete garbage. where do i go? am i meant to wonder around aimlessly? no direction? no clues other than touching grace which tells you nothing. 3 hours and 60 bucks wasted. ugh...

amazing game
Time and time again, such as it is, chaos remains the enemy. Kill all followers of chaos, stomp chaos heads in, eviscerate chaos worshippers, total chaos death.   and the rest of the game is pretty cool also.
Has actually saved me money long-term as I am now bald and no longer need to pay for haircuts. Would recommend
It's the only game where i actually wanted to do the side quests and 100% the game. 10/10 new favorite game.  Had to kill Fortissax twice before steam game me the achivement tho.
Quite the dating sim. I love all of the dialogue options you get, it makes the same seem very realistic. If you want a fun, relaxing game to let all of your stress go this is the one
New Skyrim.
the best game ever 
.
It's pretty good :)
Dont play if you like your sanity
In my opinion the story aspect of the game is bland and with lack of interaction with npcs gives an empty feeling to an open world game. Ridiculous hit boxes and obstacle / texture ( solid walls, cliffs…)  denying attacks ( as in Dark Souls 1,2,3 )  due to poor design is also a problem.   While Elden Ring promotes itself with online pvp and online co-op, internet connection plays a huge role on both of these, there is no filter on latency therefore you will either join a session with huge lag or players who join your session will have lag.

made me question my sanity
good. dying is part of the game
Game is great but it has some major design issues, input delay and AI input reading being two most frustrating things you can probably put in the video game. Some of the bosses are annoying as hell, constantly jumping all over the place while you try to get a hit or two in. There is basically two way you can play this game - cheese the crap out of it using one of meta builds (like bleed) or play it your own way, which for majority of the players will be extremely frustrating as the game will punish you for every single mistake and bad decision.   Apart from that, everything else is cool, world exploration is great, atmosphere 10/10 and wide variety of available builds is definitely massive advantage.
I like my Balls being strangled
There's not much I can say that isn't just parroting what everyone else is saying. Just get the damn game.
An excellent game were it not too large and re-use too many assets.
The game is just.. amazing. Good combat, story and bosses, may be a little overpriced but worth it trust me!
i love it
never played a dark souls but im straight up addicted to this game
The game is very fun to play and learn the enemies moveset and its fun to explore and discover new area
im gonna elden the ring or something
my favorite game of all time
THIS IS GOOD GAME YES!
open world dark souls
It's really good
Elden Ring is a hard game, but the freedom to explore the map and progress at your own pace makes it far less frustrating than earlier games in the series. It is still obtuse at times, deliberately hiding core mechanics from the player, but I feel that's part of the charm. It's refreshing to not have things handed to you and actually have to go looking.
The best survival game
play its hard tho
tigka kalo game
TLDR: Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.  GENRE: Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game  GAMEPLAY: Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops.  'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.  Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.  GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE: Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient).  In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  STORY: The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to "order". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)  STRENGTHS: •Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.  •Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.  •Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)  •You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.  •There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough  •The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.  •Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.  •Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.  WEAKNESSES: •PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.  •Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully "exit" when you quit out until a while later.  •Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.  •There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.  •UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items  •Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a "connection error" and the game boots you back to single player.  •Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.  •(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.  •So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).  •'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.  •Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.  NUMERIC SCORE (if you care): 9.9/10; easy recommend  Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.
Difficult but nice. More enjoyable than others in the series
this is a pretty good game but there are some bosses that are a little too hard but if you play a little you can beat them so i like the game so far
fun cool great game fire giant conversation between kevin and oscar from the office malenia fun awesome great fight
I’ll be honest… I almost let negativity bias affect my outlook on this game. I -really- had to sit on my experience for a bit as to not let my burning problems with the game affect my full outlook on Elden Ring. Do I recommend it? Yes, but with some caution. There are parts that I loved and parts that were absolutely asinine for me to get through. The biggest positives extend to Exploration, world design and the build variety. Exploring the world is an absolute treat. There’s so much to see in the lands between and you’re basically just… let loose with enough direction to not feel aimless. This allows you to experience the world in a way that is completely unique to you. It is so special to experience on a first playthrough. And even when I restarted the game to give it a second chance (I abandoned my first playthrough after getting frustrated) I still had a great time exploring the world all over again. Every structure you see is something you can travel through and explore and it’s super rewarding to see a massive mansion in the distance. Travel over to it and explore every nook and cranny. Of course Elden Ring didn’t invent this or anything, but it’s been refined really well in my opinion. The world design as a whole is mysterious and alluring. You want to know what lies around every corner and what the meaning of all the bizarre and fantastic things you see. The world building through Item descriptions and NPC dialog gives you insight into the world, enough to know what you’re doing. But still leaves you asking and guessing. I loved the amount of choices you are given to build your character in this one. You can do things like Tanky strength builds using Hammers and Greatswords or Quick and flashy Dex builds using Katanas and Twinblades. Combine that with the spells and incantations you get throughout the game and you get even more options. You can dedicate yourself to being a spellcaster or go hybrid with some melee options. Within the Spells and incantations there are subclasses of spells and weapons and talismans to go with them. This in tandem with the Weapon arts and ashes of war create a wonderful variety of options to pick from. The best part about all this customization is the fact that you’re able to change a lot of this stuff with general ease. So if you’re not having fun with your current build. You can try something else. The build variety is something that I’m excited to try again if I ever come back to this one. But ultimately this game has a -few- big problems with it. And my 2 biggest problems with this game are the bosses and the endgame content (Which I won’t spoil it but I will warn of it) The smaller bosses are constantly reused and overdone. They’re only really appealing to fight 1-2 times which would be fine if you only fought them sparingly. Unfortunately the minibosses you fight get reused a lot. And it gets really old, really quick. The only way they up the difficulty in reused minibosses on repeat encounters is to add another copy of the boss or add a different miniboss that doesn’t compliment the first one. Leading to lazy reuses of bosses that just serve to pad out playtime and end dungeons. They also try to spice up boss rematches by doing duo bosses but they never really work. Because the boss movesets just don’t work together in tandem because they weren't created to work together. Literally any time they tried to do a duo boss it just fails. It’s either uncoordinated and messy but functional. Or just straight up unfun and frustrating. Not to mention that certain Miniboss enemies, some of which are treated in the similar breaths to the larger encounters in the game. Can just be found in the wild just hanging around the world for no reason…  But then there’s the bigger bosses and it felt like Fromsoft went with a different approach when designing them. While I’m personally not huge on it I can see what they were going for. The bosses felt more like they were visual spectacles first and how much fun those -spectacles- end up actually being to fight come second. All the bosses look, sound, and act cool and they’re fun to fight when you’re watching somebody else do it. But when you’re experiencing some of these fights yourself the -spectacle- of them wear off real quick and the wow is quickly replaced by frustration… While the other souls games were “hard but fair” this game feels “frustrating but fair”. Sure I can dodge the mountains of bs being thrown my way but… trying to overcome these bosses feels frustrating. Sometimes I found myself wondering if some of these fights were tested to see if they were enjoyable to play instead of just “cool to look at”. What ended up happening was a minority of the fights were affecting my outlook on the larger picture. (IE: Malenia, Elden Beast, Fire Giant, Rykard) Because not all bosses are bad and unfun. Some are actually incredibly enjoyable and epic. But all of the bosses one way or another fell into one or more really annoying design pitfalls like attacks that are delayed unnaturally long, grab attacks that deal way too much damage and are way too punishing, super long combos which don’t give the player a chance to attack, and a camera that is zoomed in too close to see large enemies. Overall the bosses were the weakest part of the game and -really- hinders the replay value. Because I don’t want to redo some of these fights. Once was enough. Elden Ring’s endgame was easily the weakest part of it. Not only do the bosses get more frustrating than they were before. Not really pacing you with them and instead just, getting more unfair as you progress. The areas you explore get less open and more linear leading to a less rewarding experience. And the poor endgame (and one of the worst final bosses I’ve ever experienced in a video game) almost ruined my outlook of the game as a whole. Because it left a poor taste in my mouth walking away from the experience.     But TLDR Do I recommend Elden Ring? If you love exploring and find bosses to be secondary in your enjoyment of a game. Then I can easily recommend this one. But if you’re like me and bosses are the highlights of action games like this. Elden Ring might leave you more frustrated than satisfied. And even with certain bosses (like the final one my god why did it have to incorporate every single problem with this game’s boss design) hurting my outlook when I was walking away from it. I still found Elden Ring to be a great game. Does it have flaws? Sure but those flaws didn’t ruin the game. Would I go back to it? Given some time (and maybe DLC) I could see myself coming back and maybe just skipping the parts I didn’t enjoy so much. But overall I could see myself recommending this one.   But if you have any hangups about the difficulty… Maybe skip this one. The frustration you will experience might not be worth the positives.   4/5 Great. But not perfect.
yea
Best FromSoftware game they have ever released. Amazing game, buy it.
It's enjoyable despite the Open world sucking a good portion of the fun to me. It remains a very solid game. I would still rank Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro above it though.
just figured out why people keep saying "praise the dog" and "try finger, but hole"
Elden Ring is truly deserving of all the praise it gets. Definitely worth playing, although perhaps I recommend Dark Souls 1 a little more than this. Absolutely worth the $60.
should buy and play it
Parry Malenia they said It'll be fun they said
Get gud lmao
holy shit this game is so hard so annoying but soooo good it gets you addicted and you just want to play more 10/10
godly
dub game
Lions, Tigers, and Bears, OH MY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also an incredibly difficult boss fight with a naked lady..... 10/10 would recommend.
its the ring game about dodge
GAME TOO HARD YOU COULDNT BEAT IT, I CAN THOUGH
i've played for 100 hours and i'm still have so much left to do before the end of the game. 10/10
What can I say its Elden Ring
The New York City of video games
Elden Ring is a beautiful game. Can be a little difficult to master, but fun to experience. Game is great single player, had some connectivity issues when playing multiplayer though. When it does work it's a blast.
it fun, me mad but it fun/
Fun, thrilling, frustrating and rewarding. I've already beaten and gotten all the achievements on the Xbox version and am now having fun playing on Steam :)
Elden ring is a great game but not without flaws. first off, on the computer the game crashes and you can sometimes lose your progress. second, the camera screws you over sometimes. third, the controls are awful. it took me an hour to figur out the controls. butthat'ss all the problem. Don't expect to play a sofware game without rage.
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
funny guy hit big man with metal stick
Best game ever
All around the best game ive ever played
game is badass if ur looking to buy this buy it  
good
Breath of The Wild who?
[h1]Buying Elden Ring for the price that it's offered for in this day and age feels like daylight robbery. [/h1]Because I haven't played a single game in recent memory that comes even close to how much content there is just jam packed into Elden Ring, and not just filler content oh no no no. Tons of dungeons, a huge map that you can explore for hours upon hours and still find new things, hidden paths, huge underground areas and more !!!. Even the open world which most games offer as a "feature" is just miles ahead of anything else, the open world unlike many recent games doesn't feels lifeless and barren [strike](unless you're talking about C*elid, no no we don't talk about that)[/strike], it feels rich and full of life, the lush forests and filled with different animals and monsters alike, the mountain and plateau regions have their own biospheres and the grand cities like Leyndell and Elphael, Brace of the haligtree feels properly grand and lived in. The combat is also one of the best parts, there's a ton of build diversity in the form of different weapons, stats, spells, incantations and ashes of war. The combat feels tight and fluid and heavy weapons and swords feels like they require a lot of strength and stamina to wield.  Elden Ring is a game with insane replayability, you can play it for 100 hours and will probably come back to it for 100 more every month. [u]If you can then buy the deluxe edition, it doesn't offers anything else aside from a digital artbook and music album but it'll support Fromsoft in crafting experiences just like or better than Elden Ring in the future. [/u] [b]10/10 Must buy, and Good luck out there Tarnished.[/b]
Possibly the best game of all time.
hard and fun
MMMMMMM YESSSSSSSS
Unlimited replays.
beautiful, masterpiece.
Mid 
at the time of writing this i have 166 hours of play, I've never touched a souls like game in the past. at first, this game is hard, however if your purchasing it, you should already know. 166 hours later i completed all the achievements, and had an absolute blast doing it. so many different play styles, get your butt kicked, but when you finally kill the boss, you feel rewarded. endless play throughs . honestly i have no doubt in my mind why this was game of the year for 2022.
is good
Besides the elden beast and the Fire giant, the rest is work of art
Solid game improves upon alot of issues with older games and coop is far superior to older titles from fromsoft
VERY GOOD

"Try Finger But Hole"
I've never rage quit and come back to a game so many times before. I love the aesthetic and there is something viscerally satisfying about finally killing a boss that has kicked your ass an embarrassing number of times.
Absolute masterpiece. This game keeps impressing me even after 200 hours. Play it!
E Ring
10 OUT OF FKNG 10. ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED.
An unbelievably beautiful game. There was numerous times during my playthrough that I just stopped and looked at all my surrounding and took it all in. It’s the best game that’s been released in the last 10 years.
ranni
Best gameplay ive seen in games so far
eldn
Not fun but then very fun.

This being my first FromSoftware game, It was very difficults, but to my pleasant surprise, it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games. even after many nights of feeling like a victim, wanting to break my setup and wanting to cry.  The World My first playthrought I spent running straight into fights and regretting it soon later after i lost all my runes. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was exciting.  Even if I had trouble with a boss or an area, I could just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on. There's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss.  Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.  The Gameplay My first playthrough ended up being something like 120 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or attempting to get most items.  I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on.  The Multiplayer I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon.  When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.  Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, it was honestly kinda fun. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded.  Ending Thoughts I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly but others where extremly in detail and absolutly AMAZING.  Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.  The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zones.   The optional boss in the many areas are one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.   Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.  Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. I went with Dual wielding Katanas (My favourite build, a Moonvaile and rivers of blood)  Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I highly recommend the game! 
very very good
I like this game, vere gud :D
Became Elden Lord  Still remained Maidenless  mission failed we'll get em next time
me like
This game is in the top 3 games i have ever played. The amount of dopamine that has been released into my insular cortex has far exceeded the anger and semi-fatal frustration I have encountered in my first play through. I will give this game a 9.8/10.
i dunno
Good game
its alright
Just over 90 hrs for the first playthrough and excited to play the NG+!
i love killing depressed disabled giants for 180000 runes
so i died a lot
The most accessible Soulsborne game I have ever touched. You never feel like you're stuck since you can always leave to level/try a new tactic, but at the same time you have the unapologetic difficulty that keeps you on your toes and turns you paranoid.
It's alright.
its a cool game but it fucking sucks lol. no direction, any progress you make will be thanks to youtube, and overral just a waste of money. just an overcomplicated slow botw
Absolute top tier game 10/10
ez
ds2 is better, 10/10

this game is goated. 10/10
Game
"The graphics are dogshit"
yes
The Game its self is good, but I hate open world games so like.  Graphics are amazing Story was good  8/10 Rating for me
this is by all means a 5 star game, sadly the fact that you can get stuck in an infinite loading screen with corrupt save file you've spent hours on makes me strongly consider never playing the game again. You will more than likely enjoy this game as it's arguably one of the greatest games out there, after the refund window Fromsoftware will lock you out though and waste all that time you put into your character.
awesome
if you like giving and receiving butt stuff without any lube, this game is for you!
Writing this on my third run of elden ring (first one for pc). Although it's certainly one of the easier souls games, in my opinion it's the most enjoyable. the ability to roam as you wish, and do as you wish, gives you a lot more freedom than dark souls did. would definitely recommend Elden Ring (or Bloodborne) to people trying to get into souls games
Elden Ring has been a very challenging and rewarding Dark Souls based video game.
nihil nihil nihil
The true meaning of "whatever hasn't got you killed this time makes the game more fun with each time you died."
Frenzied Flame ending. Need i say more?

Ruined my life

MY NUTS QUAKE
try fingers,  but hole  to be serious though, I avoided this game for the last year because it felt like there was *too much* hype around it, like it would be another Cyberpunk. That was definitely not the case, the game absolutely lives up to the hype and feels immensely satisfying to play
this is probably one of the games of all time. not as good as ds3 though IMO but we'll see when the DLC comes out...
I am new to the Souls games.  I found this game pretty difficult and discouraging at first.  However, with a little time and leveling-up, I was hooked.  Awesome game if you like exploring, versatility in character development,  and a good challenge.  The environment and characters are fascinating!  I am on my second play-though and will probably start another.  Overall, an amazing game that I hope will have some DLC and a sequel in the future.
Praise the Jars
GRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
10/10
Why yes, I would indeed recommend this game to my fellow steam community. You must be, enlightened.
Epic
one of the games of all time
You will die less often than in other souls games but that's alright if you are not a masoquist such as me.
wow
worth the money 
It's awesome!
If you havent played, what are you doing. Game of year for a reason.
very challenging and fun
great 
Decent game, ruined it for myself by no lifing :(
bonk
Elden Ring,  another freakin Masterpiece from the legendary makers of Dark Souls, From Software.  True 5/7  Would buy anytime again.  Masterpiece
tip: don't panic roll
the loading gets stuck, i wonder why :(((((((((((((((
Fun unga bunga simulator that allows you to shoot spells or swing a katana for a little bit, until you devolve back into a caveman because big hammer make brain happy
Very good game. Different and better than any game I've played before
very good
good game
this game is the best game i have ever played its so good its the only game i have played recently
\
This game is amazing. One thing I will say is if you're used to games holding your hands and telling you where to go, what you're going to get and who is there. You might have to get used to this game, mainly because this game does not tell you where to go and the UI is not cluttered with information that is not necessary. It will take some time to get used to the mechanics and the way that it introduces different quest lines. Saying that this game is amazing and it has made me realize that games now a days are boring and does not give you the feeling of achieving something by yourself. I finished the game and realized that I have missed so much quests and storylines through my initial play through. Im on NG+ and I truly feel like the Elden Lord.
goopd
Fantastic
Suck dick form the back
The best single player game I've ever played
Try fingers, but hole
Awesome game. Also tried the seamless coop-mod and had a lot of fun exploring with friends and trying to beat the bosses.
I ripped my nuts off in a fit of rage
11/10
One of my top favorite games of all time. Patiently waiting for the DLC.
yes
why is it always mushroom
I listen to Lo-fi and vibe killing all the bosses with ease. There are comments about stutter. It stutters here and there, but it doesn't ruin the gameplay i think its the areas loading in. I have Elden Ring for ps4 and pc now. I originally had it for ps4 and had my lvl to 489 and had a blast exploring and collecting everything. I bought it on pc so I could play with better graphics and i'm not disappointed. The second I got on pc elden ring the increase in stable fps was noticeable. Everything was smooth and i have had a more enjoyable experience taking in the scenery and standing idle while the bosses brutally murder my corpse so I can admire all their beauty and details. This game will forever be the best game i've ever played.
400 hours and still in limbgrave GAME OF THE FN DECADE
Touch Grace
Undoubtedly one of if not the best games I have ever played. 
It took me 124 hours across seven characters to beat this game. The character that finally did it had 54 hours at the time. I don't think my stupid steam review truly matters when it concerns the 2022 game of the year, so instead this review will commemorate when I beat it.
yes
Very good game. 10/10.
9/10  very good and fun game with lots of replayability. Is only hard as you make it so people who are new to souls-like games will still have a good and not too experience if they use the tools available to them. PC port has some issues though like frame drops during some boss fights, but thats it. 
Great game for fans of Dark Souls or Breath of the Wild
Walk the road of hardship for big reward. Let the flame of ambition scare away the evil. On GTB SG.
I bought the game and booted it up. Well, tried to. The game crashed every. single. time. I tried to run it. Tried to fix it for two hours with no luck, couldn't make it past the character creation screen. I'm sure its a good game, but its so terribly optimized for pc that I couldn't even run it. If you have a ps5 or xbox x just get it on there. I can't recommend the pc version though.
It runs well on the Deck (after playing around with settings) and is the best iteration of From Software/Souls games.  It's more open and offers more forgiving controls, but will still let you know who's boss when it wants to.  Nearly incomprehensible story, which is par for the course of FS games, so unless you literally have all the time in the world I'd recommend looking through guides with impunity.  The gameplay is top notch, and the look/feel of the world is almost beyond comparison.  It's a great game, and I'm glad these have become mainstream enough for more people to enjoy.
Such an amazing experience of a game. Massive world, fuck tons of weapons and spells. Just the sheer build variety in this game is outstanding. 10/10 game if you want a challenging experience that makes you truly learn boss fights.

A masterpiece
very good the blood to my pp is flowing
For sadist
Greatest open world exploration of all time. Words aren't enough to describe the sheer scale of the world, the sense of adventure and that fear of traversing the open world because you don't know what's coming up next.  In an industry with watered down open world video games that hold your hand by marking every spot on the map, telling you wear to go, telling you what to do, a gazillion checklists strewn across the map to be "cleared", Elden Ring is a diamond. This is the culmination of Fromsoft's all the past titles and it can't get better than this. The legacy dungeons in this game or in other words, the castles and forts with Fromsoft's traditional level design are some of the best in the series.
Playing through this masterpiece was from start to finish an absolute pleasure, sometimes frustrating but that's part of the experience and what an experience this is. The world is huge, tons to explore - and exploring is never a chore, characters and environments that stimulate your imagination and really get you thinking about the lands between, the lore and how it all fits together. I absolutely recommend you play and experience Elden Ring yourself and find that like myself, you love it.
One of the best games ever, didn't like it when I had first started. Felt too discouraged to try based on the difficulty to me, but easily became easier to play and great story/characters
Great Game Love it chalenging and fun and allways something to do. A lot of replayebilitey
very hard like me :) 
one of the games in history
177 hours in I claim it is a pretty good game.
Looking for an amazing, challenging open world to get lost into. You got this.
Touch grass if you are maidenless
I'm maidenless
"♥♥♥♥ this game i hate it " *tries boss again*
masterpiece
THIS GAME MADE ME LOVE SOULS GAMES, JUST TRY IT AND YOU'LL PROB FEEL THE SAME :)
great game massive world many quests and overall great. the one problem is coop in coop you can get invaded by other players just like dark souls and also like dark souls most players only use broken pvp build that they keep finding when from nerfs the other builds. that's my review of elden ring you might not agree with me but that's what i think.
Too good
bussin
Oh hey I was just boutta go to bed I know we couldn't skype tonight But that's alright  Goodnight girl I'll see you tomorrow  (Falls and fucking dies)
gud
very good game
Absolutely love it! Took a while to get the 100% though :D
doll mommy
Good game, interested in exploring the magic huge world.
Conclusion: buy it, play it, you won't regret, especially if you are a fan of soulsborne games.  PROS: 1. Beautiful world and environmental design. 2. Stunning soundtrack. 3. Enemy & bosses design are surprisingly vast, only a couple times did I saw same NPC template being reused. 4. Key bosses are top notch, with a few exceptions. 5. Open world is rich with exploration, it is never dull to venture into the unknown for the first time. 6. Plenty of weapons and spells (didn't used any spells during my playthrough though, but their visuals for example can somewhat be observed when the bossed or NPC invaders use them). 7. Some of the annoying game mechanics of previous FromSoftware games were finally dropped.  CONS: 1. Some of the annoying game mechanics of previous FromSoftware games are still in the game, namely: runbacks to bosses,  runes not spawning before the bosses wall of fog (which is especially shameful, since there is no equivalent to the homeward bone in the game, only the talisman which breaks instead of losing runes on death), platforming sections. 2. Few and far between but terrible boss design (from the gameplay perspective, the visuals and sound are always good) still happen: from the beginning of the game a player will be overwhelmed with how fast and hard the majority of the bosses hit compared to the previous titles where it's either strong but slow or vice versa, albeit this is still manageable by [spoiler]gitting gud u scrub[/spoiler].  The problem is revealed when you come across the boss which seems to not have any weak side to it at all, for me this first was [spoiler]Valiant Gargoyles- hits like a truck from a mile away, combos are surprisingly fast with a couple of nearly unavoidable attacks some of which one shot, very maneuverable, lots of HP, there is 2 of them and they use damaging poison[/spoiler]. Later on this boss and enemy design persists, which allows for dividing all entities in just 2 categories: nuisance and death coin toss, the later being able to one shot you no matter the build\armor. Thus said some bosses just don't seem fair, namely I found this bosses to be a complete BS in no particular order: [spoiler]1. Valiant Gargoyles.[/spoiler] [spoiler]2. Godskin Duo of course.[/spoiler] [spoiler]3. Double Crucible Knights in some hero's grave.[/spoiler] [spoiler]4. Best cleric\Maliketh.[/spoiler] [spoiler]5. Radagon + Elden Beast.[/spoiler] [spoiler]6. Malenia.[/spoiler] Which is a minuscule amount considering the sheer quantity of the bosses in the game, but still shameful that a couple of them is mandatory to story progression.
poison swamps
Hahahaha man go brrrrr
My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.
It's Elden Ring. You already know you should be playing it if you're not already.
A well crafted masterpiece with small flats  Like every game, this has a few flaws mostly by repeat bosses and some balance issues  manly going through the game your not given a real sense of direction where to go this might sound like a good thing but it makes some boss fight feel impossible or way too easy.  problem 2 would be the invasion system I do understand that Fromsoftware wants this philosophy where there is never a dull moment and u always need to be on your toes  But this is the most frustrating PVP system made and I hope it gets remade or rebalanced that enemies also can attack invaders or scaling down the amount of healing pots from invaders to 1 or 2 pots max.  All in all the world and story is amazing Fromsoftware have outdone themselves 9/10    
you can do the thing were you do a do and die in 2 seconds. love it
This is a great game even more so if you like dark souls
Elden Ring is overwhelming and a pain in the fucking ass.
GAME OF THE YEAR
Overall a fun game with lots of content. The world is very nice to look at and there are lots of different enemies to fight. Sometimes the plot lines can be a bit confusing and some design choices are a bit weird, but the game is still really enjoyably.
better then overwatch
add [spoiler]sex[/spoiler] dlc
the game is very fun if you played previous titles of fromsoftware games
I don't know if im in Heaven or Hell. despite getting the 100% achievement 15 days after launch, i keep getting dragged back to this game. the build variety is limitless, and i've beaten this game so many times i have lost count. character after character, hour after hour, i always find something new and interesting each time i play this game and it feels wonderful.  i dont know who out there hasn't played Elden Ring already, but if for some reason you are on the fence, i will tell you it won Game of The Year 2022 for a very good reason.
Wunderbar!
feet simulator
Try jumping
I cannot take this game anymore download it and u will go mentally ill cuz i cant with how these Bosses work they do the stupidest shit everytime. it will make u racist aswell since u will curse whatever. and ur helpers wont work cuz they are bussy attacking something else. Download it

Best game
shouldve playd this pre-patch
udah pasti ajib
fire giant sucks A##
ok sha...
The TLDR version of this is if you are a masochist this game is for you. All jokes aside this is a very fun but frustrating game. Combat feels very frustrating at times because the controller input is not always registered, no it is not my controller, a lot of the skill with combat in this game is time based making the game a game of patience. I have noticed a lot of issues with the game closing both on my pc and steam deck but I power through it because I enjoy the game anyway. I would recommend but definitely not for everyone.
Top Notch Bosses. Top Notch Level Design. Top Notch level Art Design. Top Notch lore. Top Notch Gameplay mechanics. Top notch replayability. 
tons of poison for ya!
pain
the best game ever made
Ngl This game is super mid worse than ds2
I love the game
marika's tits
I've never played a game all the way through with over a hundred hours, set down the controller and then tell myself "I don't think I had fun playing this" before, but this one did it.    The gameplay was stale, the weapons, though many, never went beyond "hit hard" or "hit harder"  the magic system wasn't creative, it was just different colors of "shoot stuff" and the story was utter nonsense.  I shouldn't have to pull up youtube videos and wiki articles just to get the faintest grasp of what is being spewed at me.  And don't approach me and say "you just have to read everything" bullshit.  If your narrative can't support itself on its own, it's bad writing.  Bad game, regretted caving into the hype and buying it, regret having wasted my time playing it.
enoyable
Its a grind but very rewarding after you beat the game.
GOOD
Become the Elden Lord
I love the game but i just have one problem with it, dont get me wrong its an amazing experience and i really recomend it.  But since its open world and you can get almost every weapon in the game when you start or shortly after it feels a lot easier than the other souls-games.
The best shit TRUST
Loved every minute of this game!
I broke reality
pretty dope
its alright
crash
World is very open; you get a convenient mount early to make the huge map feel appropriate. Most boss fights seem to allow you to run away if it's a lot more than you expected, which also prevents the loss/death/abandonment/rage quit spirals. There are plenty of areas to grind if you'd rather not get as good at the mechanics.  I wish the player character sketched in the map as you traversed it. I wish it didn't have an always online requiement. I would rather have a more casual entirely single player experience. The game is not perfect. But it is the most aesthetic game I've seen in a very long time; often it looks like the screenshot belongs in a museum. And of all the Dark Souls games, this does seem to be in the more forgiving half, which is great because I don't enjoy the more hardcore half.  Unlike Dark Souls the game has legit magic. It is still a hack and slash first, but the magic is well developed and can be used a lot, especiallly if you spec into it. With both healing and destruction spells, it covers the basis and there might be more interesting spells I haven't gotten to or been killed by a random invader with.  As an RPG and action adventure player, this game is great. Like I said, it's a bit hard and there's nothing to do but grind. I won't fault it since it's a design decision and I don't mind grinding. If you aren't skilled, don't want to die often, and don't like grinding, you should avoid this like the plague. If you are fine with just one of them, I'd buy it at least on-sale. Of course, if you like Dark Souls, I'm sure you already bought this so just play it already.
i like it
I used to hate FromSoftware games cuz they were frustratingly difficult..  But in elden ring i was always like "What it is there?", "Can i go there?", "What if i do this?" and there is always someting to distract you. and once you finaly get to the boss you already OP. if not, there is plenty other things you can do before..  The exploration feel is real.   But the online.. (invading etc.) they basiclly ruined it. You need to be playing with someone else to get invaded so its always 1vs2, 1vs3 so usualy invader has no change to win. And its same when you invade someone.. you always against 2 or more peoples and mostly you lose.
Dark Souls on steroids 
truly a game fit for maidenless people like me 10/10
Not enjoyable at all. Terrible player progression, Enemies are scaled extremely high. Risk extremely high, reward extremely low. If you want a game that will make you want to blow your brains out, this is it.
its really hard and makes me mad sometimes but is so good i love it
smellden ring
literally the worst garbage I've ever spent money on
gud gaime. sad bunger
never played the souls games but this game is the best experience ive ever had
yes
Great game
Awesome
One of the best games I've ever played
I hate the little goblin dudes, the bleed bro, it's so fucking annoying
Honestly this game is incredibly overrated. Story is super vague and uninteresting, and combat is incredibly frustrating. It's just memorizing movesets and not making a mistake. I can see why this is "the best soulsborne" but that doesn't make it game of the year. What a waste of money. I'll keep rage-playing this just so no one can say I didn't give it a chance and I just need to git gud, but I swear I'll update when I've beat the game that it's still bad.  The super punishing boss fights are fun because they're bosses. I will give the game that. I like Monster Hunter, I like Remnant, I like bosses that are really hard. They're incredibly cheap and purposefully designed so, but they're right on the edge of punishing and too cheap, and they're bosses so fine. But for miniboss types or exploring the story path, the basic design of this game is really annoying. If you die when you get to a new enemy type, which you will, CONSTANTLY, then you have to wade through a bunch of mooks who can kill you in three shots by stunlocking you with a buddy, and congrats, now you've lost all the runes you had on your fucking corpse retrieval. Who does corpse retrievals still in 2022? So to get to the new enemy you have to play perfectly just to get another shot, but they are all designed with incredibly unpredictable movesets with halting, unnatural moves so you can't predict when to block or dodge. The whole game concept feels like that mario maker video where every time mario jumps an invisible hazard pops out as an F you. F you, you had no way of knowing this would happen, but now you do. So go back and if you successfully predict that move, awesome, he's got branching paths off the same stance that have equally unpredictable moves. I don't understand why people think dying a ton in order to learn a moveset is fun. And again, the moves are designed to be unpredictable. You can't learn your skills and get good at the game and get better, you have to learn each individual enemy type.  And it's not just the mechanics of combat that has bad cues, the rest of the game does too. The giant tree knight at the beginning is way too hard to fight. Ok, I understand that after a try or two, but the tutorial, the dude you talk to at the beginning, the tip screens, no one says "hey, you need to be careful, don't try to kill everything." There are no hints that the bigger something is, the more dangerous it is. There are no hints that if you get stuck, you should go screw around somewhere else and level up, then come back. ALL of that has to be learned through internet research (bad design) or banging your head against the wall so you're frustrated and now have a sour taste in your mouth after owning the game for a few hours. Even like exploring, the game tells you explicitly to follow the glowing paths, but if you do so you'll be incredibly underleveled. So not only do you need to explore the whole section of the map you uncover, you need to go off into gray unexplored sections as well. ALL of this is counter to standard game design and gamer instincts. That doesn't make the game original and inventive, it makes it bad because it doesn't tell you any of that. It's a choose your own adventure book that says "make sure to read the story" and doesn't mention you can skip around.  I legitimately don't understand how this game has mass appeal. For fans of the genre, sure, absolutely. But a game of the year should transcend genre. A truly amazing game is at least fun to play for a while even if you're not a fan of the genre. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when people talk about the wide appeal of this game.
no pickle ahead  edit: tired dog, found pickle
Best game ever in my opinion.
gud game, gud horsey
yeah... its good enough
I was about ten hours into the game and having a good time when I went into a cave and came across a group of about six or seven enemies that I couldn't take on because they all killed in two to three hits and there was no way to pull them one or two at a time. I tried to fast travel a way to level up a little, but it was disabled for some reason. So now it is just an endless loop of die respawn without even the opertunity to get stronger. I can't understand why the devs would let someone get softlocked like that, especially when fast travel has been functional everywhere else I've been in the game. would refund if i could.
It's alright I guess
peak
Fun time But god some of these bosses are stupid and so unfun to fight
it won game of the year for a reason

{;
you're late for work and have to eat 2 bowls of cap'n crunch really fast, but there's no milk.   also I like elden ring.

Everything there is to say about the game has already been said. It's not flawless, but it's absolutely worth your time and money.

best souls game
beat melania
boner
sexy
Fun exploration and a great starter souls game
its is fun and i like it :) 
Best game I've ever played! Highly recommended！
It becomes a somewhat fun game once you invest time and start to understand the mechanics and how the world works. Like other FromSoftware games, the challenge of playing difficult bosses and beating them in and of itself is part of the rewarding experience. The scenery and some of the dungeons / locations can be stunning. My problem with this game is the open world aspect, the story lines, and the characters. The world is vast but empty. For the size of the world, NPCs are too few, most are simply silly and childish, and, like the bosses, they are unrelatable and there is no real depth to their story. What's more, your character, the overarching story line and the side quests utterly fail to captivate. Dungeons, mines, enemies, and boss fights are repeated over and over again in an attempt to populate the open world and weak story line. The endings are a total let down. This game is just too much of a waste of time for what one gets out of it.
10/10

"I thrust the sword towards my final foe, teetering on the edge of my life. And as the rays of gold faded and perished, it was then that I knew my labor was finished. With only the blissful silence of the world as my company, I thought back to another, simpler time...  Once upon a time, I had awoken with just the clothes on my back, and a weathered blade in my hand. Swallowing my fear, I reached out towards the waking world, and the world struck me down; Oh it struck me down many a times! And yet, after each and every death, I arose to fight once more. No matter the ordeal,  no matter what unholy beast had devoured me, I would fight again and again in the name of that dream; that one day, I would stand beneath the Erdtree as Elden Lord. Thus, here I am.  I stood before my rightful throne, thinking back to all those that led me here...  Ceremoniously, I sheathed the sword of the warrior I couldn't save. It's sharp edge has served the Finger Hunter and I well. Then, I dusted off the armor of my fallen friend, its protection has kept me alive more times than I could count. Day by day, I hope that the half-wolf is at peace. After that, I sat upon my rightful throne. Unconsciously, I twirled holy fire in my hand. Miriel's teachings were vast, inspiring, wonderful, as is Miriel. I should pay him a visit...  Carefully, I reached onto my belt, grasping the winged sword insignia tightly; a last gift from the girl of scarlet hair. Perhaps the most important person I've met other than my faithful maiden; The girl who's sword was unbreakable, her will, even more so. The girl who fought side by side with me from the beginning, the girl who's hair shall stay scarlet forever —is someone I will never forget.  In the beginning, I walked the ruined world as a tarnished. Now, I stand as the Elden Lord...   and one day, you can too."
ranni twerk mod
amazing open world experience
This game is horrible. Redundant death. You lose your health bar when you die over and over just to spin for hours and drool.
This game has been my first from-software game an i have enjoyed every step of the way through playing while there were some moments where i got quite annoyed after i managed to get past those area's i felt very proud of myself the difficulty of the game was a nice change from most of the games i play and can't wait for more of my future play troughs
I avoided this game for a while because of the reputation for difficulty.  I played it for a bit last spring and ended up grinding *a lot* in order to get good enough to beat the bosses, but continuously failed because I didn't know about iframes, and didn't know about the ability to summon.  Positives: The world is huge and fully explorable.  If you like the explorability of skyrim, you'll probably love this, for similar reasons.  There are lots of different types of monsters and they're weird and alien and eerie and often wonderful  The lore is deep and nearly impenetrable.  There are lots of fun uses of language that I hadn't encountered before.    Negatives: You must use external sources to understand just about everything.  The in-game explanations of mechanics is basically non-existent past the tutorial.  Also, from what I gather, the plot is crazy convoluted, and I am concerned that it will be too complex to gain any satisfaction from the ending.  But all in all, a great success!
A game where you can go at any point to escape reality. Love it
its elden ring
It was an one in one game
Spectacular. Top to bottom, the best thing From Software has ever made.
This game is one of the best games ever made. I've beaten this game 5 times and can't get enough of it. There is so many ways to play this game. Mage, Cleric, Rogue, and Warrior it has so much variety in every playthrough. I'm not going to beat around the bush. This game is HARD. If you do not like Souls game or Souls-like game you will not like this game. Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4 with a different story. It's Open World is what makes it really different from the other Souls game. Keep finding new ways to beat this game. Give a try if you want to punish yourself.
Melhor jogo de 2022 sem sombra de dúvidas. Dá pra ficar horas e horas, fazendo tudo, montando sua build. Recomendo.
Spent the whole day configuring my character and then got killed by a horse man 10/10 would do it again
go buy it now
Absolute masterpiece!
If you want ez mode use magic or blood weapons
Very good. i liked the challenge that this game propposed. You have to overcome masny adversaries. 
good game has nice lore lots of different and challenging ways to play . But if you don't mind playing solo   the downside is  the co op system is a nightmare   1. you can't use your mount in co op and this is a game you would wan't the use of your mount the map is huge   2. can't reset at campsite / site of grace   3.  i notice when i join someone my hp was cut in half and i was at full hp as soon as i go back to my own game the missing hp goes back   4.  is the most annoying  is the invasion of other players there should be a cap or a timer on how may times  someone can invade players in co op  " or  just make a option to turn off the invasions of other players  " so players can play co op in peace  with there friends  without being invaded by someone every 5 to 10 mins .

Too easy
I am so sad I can only play this game on weekends because this game is crazy. Definitely the best game i have ever played in my opinion and it has opened my eyes to other games like the dark souls series, bloodborn, and sekiro.
GAME OF THE YEAR 2022
Lots of rings not that much Elden
:D
this is game of the decade
ringi :D

YUP ITS FUN!
fun
gud
amazing
. 
Fun, but difficult.
The first, and likely only, game I am completely content with constantly dying in. 10/10 would recommend to a masochistic friend.
Game of the Year, that says it all
No sex mod :(
Game about and Old Ring and you can hit bosses
yes 
Sensational
I've just started Soulsborne games, and even though I've died 1 million times, the game is pretty cool and fun. It probably wasn't voted the game of the year for nothing :D  Definitely Recommend 10/10
This game is terrible. I can't appreciate its beautiful scenery and interesting plot lines and characters because I'm too busy angrily mashing my face against the same optional boss for three hours. I don't even feel great when I beat one of these bosses, the only accomplishment is not having to face off against it anymore (at least until the inevitable NG+ run).  Alright, now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go play Elden Ring for another 250 hours.
.
Just a masterpiece
yes
Beautiful game. I'm currently nearing the end of my first play through and i love it. Among many other people this is my first souls like game and it has not disappointed at all. The story is immersive and it has very interesting lore as well as great characters ,  (although spoiler most of them die). my only criticism is it is very difficult to pick up this game, its very easy to get lost if you don't know what you are doing and sometimes the intended path is difficult to follow
good init
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES OF ALL TIME A GREAT PURCHASE
Go check out Malcolm Reynolds on Youtube first of all, cool guy.  So this game has a problem, a big one. The devs are trying to stomp out all cheating, so the coding community has double downed and created multiple ways to bypass EAC WHILE ONLINE. Welcome to the old DS3 days of getting crashed, and softbanned without knowing your inventory was edited. The issue isn't incredibly prevalent right now, but as a former CE coder for DS3 I can tell you quite easily where we are headed.  Once the game drops in price, it'll be overran. A lot of people now are just using whatever edits they can get away with, and some people are even buying multiple copies to ban evade. So right now it's not a super invasive issue, but within a year it will be. The price drop will hit, hackers will buy up multiple copies, and the harassment will begin. Do you remember frame DCed? Do you remember the crashes so bad that you had to restart your PC? Do you remember being teleported into a room, with no way out, and all your bonfires disabled? We are heading that direction. It's inevitable no matter what they do with the AC, but now the devs are trying to ban anyone, and everyone who uses any sort of edit of any kind.   I don't see harm in people editing their level for PvP, and I don't see issues with people creating new builds via CE editing (changing bullet values so you can use boss spells, or spells that are hidden within the code) A lot of this is really cool, and we even made a community in DS3 to prevent blackhats from ruining our fightclubs. We'd have an omega hacker defending the fight club, crashing anyone he detected as a blackhat. Now? Nobody wants to defend anymore, and you can still be force invaded at any time. There's no way to defend yourself unless you want to catch a ban. I personally ran countercheats to crash hackers if they messed with me. Now? Defending myself will net me a ban.  Now let's talk about the game.  This is by far the hardest "souls" game to be released, the threads complaining about everything after you reach the point of no return, are numerous. The ultra super special boss, even popular streamers are saying shes boring, and the only way to win is to remember her combos perfectly. No variation to that fight, if you try to get some space, rush combo, if you try to position, rush combo. It's just playing 100% defense and hoping you can land occasional hits. If she manages to hit you, she heals. So that's fun.  Outside the last 4 or 5 bosses, the game is great. Once you hit that endgame it's like the Berlin wall, won't come down for some time. The majority of players I talk to are gated after or right before Fire Giant. The game RAMPS incredibly hard during that period, where a fully kitted, max level, max stat character can still be 2 shotted. How do you think those fights go for anyone around 140? The recommended level. It doesn't, seen too many people whine about difficulty, and quit.  I personally agree, the late game ramps just a little too hard, and relies on mechanics that are just not fun. I'd rather play bloodborne, or DS3 any day. Most people who disagree with my opinion, also follow with "GIT GUD LOL BAD SCRUB" Yet, I'm not seeing as many as I did during DS3, maybe it's because that game was actually fair? Only 33% of players have beat that super hard boss that I was talking about early on, and 19% of players have even beat the game. Some people say that the last two bosses of the story, are harder than anything else. I personally think that the secret boss is the hardest boss I've ever beat legit. This is coming from someone who soloed the bloodborne DLC with no deaths from the bosses. Soloed all the souls games except this one, there must be something wrong here right?  Food for thought. Not really worth 60$ for a game that you will probably quit near endgame.
good 
Pain.
 hard 
Exploration and combat is great and it is one of the best games I've played
amazing. there's something special about getting constantly wrecked and still having a good time. love this game. it's like skyrim meets 1000 ways to die.
The game is good :)
It is a good anger inducing game.
BEST GAME, ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO IN IT 
Shit's cool, man.
Weird fight mechanics, can either move or defend, cannot defend while moving. No sprint option? If you clear out a section of map from enemies, and resources, they just spawn back.  Overall an over hyped boring game, and the lore sounds like it can be generated by a online lyrics generator website. Re-spawnig is weird, for a game this messy, least developers could have done is have a decent save-mechanism.This game is an utter waste of time.  Gonna stick around for a bit because I paid for it, but this game ain't my thing.
Genuinely the best open-world game I've ever played. From the beginning it strikes you with it's uniqueness and exceptionality. Unlike all the Ubisoft and other mainstream games, Elden Ring lets you explore the world by yourself without holding your hand and rewards every second of it. The fact that not everyone can do it makes defeating a boss feel all the more like an actual achievement instead of a chore. The combat feels smooth. Topping it off with amazing world-building and well written characters, as well as an immersive yet subtle storyline to give meaning and depth to your journey makes for a 10/10 game.
im too bad at it
It is really good, beat it a couple of times.
musashi
just get it. best way to put
Best Game hands down. Never had any problems with bugs or anything just a complete game, unlike most games that get released these days.   Dont give up just keep playing and learn how the game works. Use everything the game gives you and oh does it give a A LOT if you really look. or just git good...

A fantastic and epic adventure that sets the standards for what a single player game should be. It has a deep lore, great fighting mechanics, amazing world building, artistic vistas, and possibilities for multiple play styles. It rewards curiosity and skill. It lives up to the high expectations of a souls game. Highly recommended.  However, I am not sure if it is my favorite souls game. Although, the open world helps temper the difficulty level of the game making it more accessible to players new to the souls games, that also introduces a lot of redundancies into what can otherwise be a shorter and more classier experience. In past souls games (specially DS1), bosses have been more than just about rolling and hitting. That has slowly gone away and in its place we have some bosses that can one-hit you even if you have a thousand hp. ER does give us mounts, crafting, and other quality of life improvements, but I'm not sure if that gain is worth the loss of the classical charm.

Brings me anger and joy.
I wasn't sure if I will enjoy this game as I have rage quited souls like games before and kinda gave up on the genre, but I managed to  pull through, I reached lvl 100 and so far only chose to not engage in 1 boss fight. I could kill anything the game threw at me, some easier than others. I have yet to be stuck on a boss for more than a few hours.  The biggest pro of the game is the exploration, it is old school open world, and we definitely need more of those around these days.   The biggest con is the dual boss fights, they are horribly designed and I almost quit when I had to fight 2 burial dogs, The worst is that you have a dual boss that's part of the main story and it is one of the hardest dual bosses too, I might quit when I get to it, or I'll cheese it, still recommend the game though, it's definitely worth
As someone who doesn't play many games. As I find them boring. Nor do I have much time. I do find myself enjoying this game. The game is a fun open world combat based game. Where everything literally wants to kill you. With cool discoveries to be found in unexpected places. The games ridiculously hard too. I was having trouble at the beginning of the game trying to kill the feeble soldiers of all things.   If you do not have much gaming experience(like me) I  wouldn't recommend this game. For this is not a game that holds yer hand like all those MMOs. Nor is it easy to slay any of the behemoths and foul monsters that are littered across the land. You'll most likely end up catching the contagious disease of rage which may lead to unwanted side effects. However newcomer, if you are certain that you have the patience and are up for the challenge. You are quite welcome to venture into this new dystopian universe. Best of luck newcomer. :)
Phwshff... do I recommend this game. I guess? This game is go fuck yourself levels of hard. And where the fuck do I go to the maximum levels of big. It's overwhelming, and not always in a good way. As far as FromSoftware games go, I think I prefer Sekiro. Visuals range from stunning to gray tornado mess. Lore is great, if you can understand any of it. Of all of my hours, I was probably having fun for 75% of them. The rest was "where do I go" "who is this" "what is this" "how do I activate this" etc.   This is, by far, the most frustrating game I have ever played. But yeah, I still recommend it.
Really fun so far, love the creativity with the boss fights
I'm not typically a fan of these types of games. I could never get into Dark Souls so I never tried to get into any of the other FromSoft games until I heard everybody talking about how good Elden Ring was at work. I was still skeptical so I waited until the game went on sale before trying it out.  I wish I had tried it sooner.  The addition of the open world and the ability to skip hard encounters and come back later has really improved the playability of this game. The world is phenomenally crafted and is much more enjoyable to traverse than the likes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla & Hogwarts Legacy (two games I've also played recently). The world is beautiful and there always seems to be a surprise everywhere you look. I've been wanting to replay Skyrim for awhile, but haven't because I want to enjoy a game that I have yet to play. Elden Ring scratched that Skyrim itch.  Elden Ring is still a hard FromSoft game, but it is much less forgiving than most of their releases. Checkpoints are more numerous and closer together. A lot of difficult encounters are optional. The tough encounters will make you feel very empowered when you finally overcome them.  Elden Ring is gold and absolutely deserves to be name Game of the Year. Play it!
Hello dear friends and fellow gamers,  I would like to give my honest opinion on what I think about this game. It´s amazing.  Thank you
Ranni is bae, best ending.  10/10 would play again, slightly frustrating moments but would play again for sure. Never trust the messages!
females are nice looking. especially...
bad game
A sense of exploration like no other.
sword go brr 
top tier. god level. has ascended past the heavens. Solo killed ever single player in one go. THE ONE. THE ONLY.  Naotoshi Zin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  best game. this shit like crack.
gut gam
-This is a work of art. From the graphics and map design to the combat, everything is gorgeous, polished and well thought out.   -Elden Ring allows the player to choose their own difficulty, the order in which they progress and even the game's ending.  -NG+ is a lot of fun, offering much more replay value than starting naked.   Enjoy your first run and venture out into the vast and cruel world that's filled with things which want to kill you!
I have never played a game that enthralled me so much. I had to take a break from the game but I still find myself thinking back or playing it from time to time. It is both harder and easier than other souls games and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed them. I would also recommend ER to people who enjoy large-scale open world games with lots of magic and no transphobia.
basic combat not gun
get MURDERED by some weird abomination in the middle of an eldritch environment
pretty cringe tbh...
this game boring and way too easy and way too boring.  its a  walking simulator where once you reach a certain level its all one hit kill even against players an bosses while also being on the hardest difficulty
I would suggest watching a walkthrough if this is your first time playing
GOAT
A good game if your looking for a challenge, would've liked to play it more exclusively with friends though instead of mostly solo with friends only being able to help with bosses.
Best game of the decade
epic sauce if it was a game
👍
Beautiful game. cannot recommend enough
you can kick dogs
hèn ring muôn năm ez ng+

Yep
good
what is there to hate about this game it is amazing i will recommend this game till the end of time one of the best games ive ever played and the game just never ends.
Rolling required ahead
Open world souls....elegant...irritating...wonderful...frustrating...glorious..I HATE YOU FROMSOFTWARE DIE!....oh my god this is EPIC!...THANK YOU FROMSOFT ....
Become THE Elden Lord, not "an elden lord". Never give up! Use online guides, use the guide book, use any and all tools needed to play and enjoy becoming all-powerful!
...The battle is over, I see. To every living being, and every living soul. Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness. Well then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal.
If you have money buy game very cool
Ultimate dying simulator now in open world.  You can die and die again as always but now you can do it in a huge map.  You can be bunt by a dragon while exploring a hillside, You can be stabbed in the back by a worthless zombie guy who can barely walk, You can be poisoned by a damn flower instantly and die like a rat middle of the forest, You can be thrown by a cliff, fall from a narrow pass, get eaten, get chewed and spitted like a gum.  You can be humiliated and your patience can be tested in various ways.  If you find your daily life not enoug challenging and stressfull, now you can make it more challenging and stressfull in open world.
what is there to hate about this game it is amazing i will recommend this game till the end of time one of the best games ive ever played
after 90 hours and getting every achievement, I can proudly say that godskin duo is absolute dogshit
best game, will be goty 2023 100% honest
How do I jump?????
I just want to give Morgott a hug :(
gud gejm
In short, I feel like FromSoftware took all the aspects we liked from previous Soulsborne games and crafted this beautiful open-world RPG with it. It is a wonderful introduction to the genre of "souls-like."  [b]Things I Liked:[/b] - The "play at your own pace" world structure. You aren't limited to a linear progression, so if you want to get stronger or explore other areas, you are able to do so. You don't have to fight main bosses with just what you gather in the starting area. In fact, if you don't care about 100%ing the game, you can completely skip some areas you don't like (looking at you, [spoiler]Caelid[/spoiler].) - More Grace Sites (bonfires)! I know in previous Soulsborne games, part of the challenge of the game was the fact that bonfires were spread out so much. But in Elden Ring, I don't think having so many Graces significantly lowers this challenge. Considering that Elden Ring is open-world, the amount of Grace Sites feels appropriate, and I think less would actually hurt the game. - The many different endings. Each ending [spoiler]significantly alters the world of Elden Ring[/spoiler] and there is no obvious "good" or "bad" ending. So this aspect combined with the many different classes/builds you can do makes every playthrough of Elden Ring unique and fun. - The spirit summons (also in the section below). Spirit summons help you feel not so alone when you're fighting bosses and can be really helpful in splitting agro. I especially thought [spoiler]the Mimic Tear[/spoiler] was a really cool experience and idea.  [b]Things I Didn't Like:[/b] - The spirit summon reliance. Spirit summons are a really, REALLY useful tool against bosses. To the point that some bosses can be trivialized with them. You can fight bosses without them, but you almost feel like you have to use them, since it seems like some of the bosses are built with the usage of spirit summons in mind. What I'm trying to say is: I think the bosses would be more challenging and satisfying to kill if spirit summons weren't so OP. - The multi-boss fights. Specifically, [spoiler]the Godskin Duo[/spoiler]. Nasu put it well: in previous Soulsborne games, when you would encounter a multi-boss fight, one would usually take a more "passive" stance when the other is in a more "active" stance. This was a good balance. But in Elden Ring, they are usually both in a hyper-aggressive active stance which can definitely be frustrating to deal with. - You can't revisit [spoiler]Leyndell Royal Capital[/spoiler] after you [spoiler]defeat Maliketh[/spoiler]. This makes sense lore-wise, but it is frustrating if you're playing Elden Ring blind or simply didn't realize you didn't explore that area enough until it's too late. A fix perhaps would be to have a feature in the Roundtable Hold where you can toggle which version of [spoiler]Leyndell[/spoiler] you want access to after you beat the game.  Overall, I can see why Elden Ring gained so much popularity, including from those where this was their first souls-like game. Its Game of the Year title was well-deserved. I highly suggest playing it if you haven't already.
buy if you love pain
nutty
Miyazaki is Tarantino of video-games.
i love dicks
Game's just awesome man.
this is a good game i don't have a lot of hours but i'm enjoying it so far. I would encourage ass many people as possible to play this well designed polished artistic game, and i hope that people will play it because of this really good review that is extremely well spoken and well written review.

"yes" from souls veteran.
yo waddup
Best game i've ever played.
Praise the Fingers !
Yea, theres a reason it got its awards. Its pretty much a better Dark Souls 3, so if you liked DaS3 then you'll love this. There is nothing for me to add that hasnt been said, heck I even caved in and bought it, when I always wait for a GOTY edition. Am I satisfied with my purchase? Yea, I enjoyed it more than DaS3 thats for sure. For one experimenting with weapon arts on different weapons is fun finding what suits you better. Cons: well the copy+paste bosses do get repetitive, especially those snake trees with their frantic movements and weird hit boxes that made me question ''how did my 2meter sword not hit it?'' And the final boss was a complete hemorrhoid in my ass, not cause its hard, not cause of skill issue, but cause it runs away constantly while throwing drivebys with holy projectiles (hope you got that holy protection talisman, another free tip: get something that has black flame, me being an ungabunga melee build had to use Godslayer or blackflame tornado). Yea it took me less tries than Malenia, but there it was a skill issue or greediness on my part, here it was more like praying to RNGesus for it to stand still for me to whack it, dunno maybe mages or priests have an easier time with it, but my monkey brain didnt have a fun time with it.
Do I even need to write a review?
Whats with price spike lol
Personal Rating: 10/10 My 1st Souls-like playthrough from FromSoftware  Pros ~ Breathtaking visuals and landscapes ~ Memorable boss battles ~ Plethora of different playstyles ~ Rewarding exploration  Cons ~ Some mysteries are hard to solve without the help of the community  "Dog"
best game since 2022
[i]To every living being, and every living soul. Now cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.[/i]
One of my favorite games! The boss fights are the best and the story is interesting. Give this game a chance, I'm sure you'll like it too! If you don't like the game you're just maidenless.
a really great game but you need to grind a little too much gear at the start it took me 3 hours for 2 sets of armor and some of the best weapons (best starter weapons)
um good game
Very good game. Amazing open world, great atmosphere,great music, very good boss design. The game doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go which is sometimes frustrating cause the beautiful scenery will most of the times drag you to areas that are too hard for your current level. Harder than the Souls games so it is not the best FROMSOFT game to start with. Overall an amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend
goated game
Loveable sort ahead.  One of the best video games of all time. 10/10
Yes, very yes!
git gud 10/10

I love this game.
No wonder its Game of the Year Just Brilliant
TRY JUMPING
If you play Dark Souls 1 2 & 3, this game is your calling. [i] 10/10 [/i]
good game
Out of all the open world games in the current market, this game is at the top, no question asked. Even the classics like Skyrim, Witcher, Far Cry etc don't stand a chance against this behemoth. This game will literally f=ck you hog wild in the anus and your concept for open world games and will make you a new man. Right from the start, when you reach Limgrave the game doesn't hold you back like the other souls games where you have to complete an area in order to access the next region, as it gives you freedom to go anywhere you like which I really loved about this game. Even games like Witcher, Far Cry has the same problem which I totally despise where if you go to a new region, you immediately get f*cked as there is a level system in the game.   After playing for 117 hrs, I'm still finding soo many hidden caves, bosses, and new areas which I wouldn't have enjoyed if the game gave me side quests right from the get go. I feel like because of the freedom, this game will make you curious about the whole world and the secrets that it holds for the player. As the AAA games industry is on life support right now for making the same ol' garbage repeatedly like Forspoken, Cyberspunk 2077, 100th sequel for Call of Duty, Horizon No Game Award, and that Halo game with no players etc. FromSoftware somehow shined through which I wasn't expecting of as I was quite scared for this game due to the recent trend of unfinished, buggy releases of AAA games.  This game has a lot to explore and the devs have added and changed certain things make it kind of look like a non-souls game like the "Jump" button which gives accessibility to the players, different weapon arts for different weapons which you can swap, get assistance from ashes which will aid you in boss battle and the biggest addition of all, a horse which would help you tremendously to traverse through the whole map.  To end that note, all I'm gonna say is that Miyazaki made all the studio devs in the AAA game industry do a goatse in front of the public.
Best game ever.
Spammed jump attacks on every boss and won easily, then got invaded by a guy named ***** starter and he put on a big hat and one-shot me with death blight. 10/10 will meme again.
its ok
When people think of what a video game should be, this should be one of the things that pops into their mind. Please do yourself the favor of playing this game. Sure, there are some parts that aren't perfect but the time between those rough Patches are some of the most fun, challenging, rewarding and fully realized pieces of gaming and world building out there.
I played this on PS5 launch, 2 days later collected all trophies, and finally a randomized modded run for pc. Its GOTY for a reason. Find it really fun people want an easy mode for this game. Same kinda people who can't get past cup head tutorial sadge.
this was my first souls game. im now going to play the others
As someone who was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and given less than a year to live, I'm incredibly grateful to have played elden ring before my time runs out. This game is a true masterpiece, with every aspect, from the gameplay to the atmosphere, graphics, and story (if you look), expertly crafted. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves immersive and engaging gaming experiences. Thank you to the developers for creating such a fantastic game that has given me joy and excitement during a difficult time.
it good
This game said I had no b*tches, 0/10!!!

This game has no flaws. Worth every penny

Wonderful and beautiful game! Definitely tough to get used to on the PC, and had to find the setting to change the buttons showing on screen from Xbox to PC (took me a while to figure out that was the problem...thought it was just glitched lol). But if you enjoy Dark souls, Bloodborne or any game of the sort similar to that, you'll really enjoy this game!
i prefer dark souls but ER was great
game makes me break my keyboard, but i love it, so we good
I die :( Then I win :)
pain
Beautiful game. Extremely hard too =)
its like dark souls but bigger
THIS GAME F_U_C_K_S
Great game.  I'm a big fan of DS3, and From Software really improved on it with Elden Ring
It's alright
This game is more or less like every other FromSoft game, for better and worse. There's really no reinventing of the wheel here aside from the open world. In some cases this works against and in favor of the player experience.  The open world aspect is pretty fun, there's a lot of really picturesque things to see and screenshot worthy areas that are incredible first time around, but that's kind of where the benefits end. If that's a huge deal to you, you'll love it. For everything else, it's kind of a step in the opposite direction. Quests follow the standard FromSoft 'we won't tell you shit about what you're supposed to do, who to find, who to kill, figure it out on your own.' This approach is serviceable in their other games because of their size but is terrible in a game this large. It might give players an excuse for multiple NG+, but when you spent upwards of 150 hours and there are quests you still need to look up online because you have no idea what random shit ends them or where to go, and this is every quest, it becomes a problem. It's more of a problem when, in FromSoft fashion, much of the lore is hidden behind items, subtle interactions that may or may not have branching paths (again, some of which end quests entirely). To me, this is just not enjoyable. I don't mind having to find items to learn the lore, but the content is not easily accessible and becomes an irritation. The open world also makes this game the easiest to over level on, either accidentally or on purpose. I ended up clearing Caelid after Stormveil Castle because of the lack of direction and trivialized much of the game after and I feel like I lost out on a lot of first time experiences because of it when I went back to lower level areas.  The PvP is also in a god awful state. The balancing is more or less OK after so many iterations of patches, but the lag is terrible. People walking through your spells and attacks, frames in animations being skipped, a hit registering and dealing no damage (I found this one out using Gargoyle's Blackblade), or being plus frames in a situation and the lag makes you lose out -- a colossal weapon beating out a rapier in speed for instance.   The camera and lock-on are also some of the biggest messes I've seen since Red Ninja, the platforming is still mostly unusable and should be scrapped entirely.  It's not all bad though. Despite some bosses having broken hurt boxes, they're mostly well designed and challenging. The characters themselves, once you're actually able to access their lore, have some of the most compelling stories in any FromSoft game. This is easily FromSoft at their best if we ignore Sekiro, which was a masterpiece, and makes it hard to really look at any earlier Souls games without wondering why you wouldn't just play this instead. You should probably get it if these types of games interest you, but there are some pretty big glaring issues and some subjective things you might not enjoy. I still can't get over the experience systems in these games, but I accept it when I play them.
great
Good game if you wanna replace your monitor
git gud cause it good
TLDR: Everybody knows this game is good, you don't need me to tell you. If you're afraid it's too difficult for you, there are strategies to make the game easier. If you have the money and the time to spend on this game, it will be worth them both, trust me.  My experience: That said, as a souls fan, I didn't feel like this game really attended my expectations (which to be fair where problaby very high). It's weird to describe: part of me loved this game, but another part of me was also expecting something else, or for things to be different about it, I don't know.  Probably the biggest part of the insatisfaction I have with this game is the "level-scaling system" (for lack of a better term. It's actually the interaction of the XP system with the open word system): because it's such an open game, you end up missing entire areas when you're at their intended level, and when you actually find them, those areas are way too easy for you. This happened so much so that I had this doubt of having my level way too low/high throughout basically the whole game. Not only is this the first time I feel that in a souls game, it is also really annoying, because you always have that feeling in your head: "Damn, this boss was so hard, was my level way too low for him?" or, even worse: "This boss was so easy! I guess my level is way too high for this section of the game" (the latter happened to me more often, which is a shame). This happens mostly with the optional bosses, but having this constant thought in my head really detracted from my experience, I believe. Overall I think the openness of the map as opposed to previous titles was a double-edge sword: It provided incredible moments of wanderlust and exploration, but also made me not enjoy the main parts of the game as much.
Didnt think I would like a souls like game. Boy was I wrong.

Having had the opportunity to engage with FromSoftware's latest magnum opus, Elden Ring, it can be unequivocally stated that this game is a tour de force of the gaming industry, and truly the finest example of the medium to date. With an unparalleled sense of immersion and gameplay mechanics that are both innovative and refined, Elden Ring has exceeded all expectations and delivered an experience that is simply unparalleled.  The game's world-building is a triumph of imagination and artistic vision. The open-world design, with its countless vistas and captivating architecture, instills a sense of awe and wonder in the player, drawing them in and encouraging them to explore every inch of this vast landscape. The lore of Elden Ring is equally compelling, with a rich and complex history that is both tantalizing and elusive, revealing itself in pieces over time as the player delves deeper into the game.  The combat system in Elden Ring is a masterpiece of design, combining the best aspects of FromSoftware's previous titles with new mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. The player has access to a wide range of weapons, spells, and abilities, each with its own unique properties that can be combined and modified to suit the player's playstyle. The game's bosses are equally impressive, with each one providing a unique and memorable challenge that requires the player to adapt and overcome.  Elden Ring's graphics and sound design are a feast for the senses, with stunning visuals that are brought to life by a haunting and evocative soundtrack. The attention to detail in the game's environments, characters, and enemies is truly staggering, with every aspect of the game designed to enhance the player's immersion in the world.  In conclusion, Elden Ring is a game that transcends its medium, a true masterpiece of design, artistry, and storytelling that will stand the test of time. It is a game that will be remembered for years to come as the pinnacle of what is possible in the gaming industry, and a shining example of what can be achieved through creative collaboration and a dedication to excellence.

Hehe, Lightning Spear go ZZZZZZZZZ

I've never played a Souls game before this and I had a blast. An extremely fun and challenging game.
Fia died
One of the best games you could find. Multiplayer is a little rough but still playable. If you are looking for something to pour too much time into, your search is over. Once you get into it, it becomes very clear why it won GOTY.

Awesome game held back by a poor port to pc. Stutter and lag at the worst of times and should have been fixed by now.
I wish there was a mixed option. I don't think the game is bad, but I definitely prefer the smaller more condensed metroidvania type level design in Fromsoftwares previous games.

Hard, complex, yet a very enjoyable and satisfying game to play.
dlc where i can marry boggart is necessary but besides that its perfection
   I'm going to lead with the fact that this is my favorite souls game by significant margin. I have played, enjoyed, and look back fondly on the entire franchise, but something about the first play-through of this game makes the rest look paltry in comparison. Elden Ring takes a franchise renown for its depressing mood, Incredible level design and fair but brutal combat and turns it on its head in one of my favorite reimaginings since Jak 2 on the PS2.   Tight corridors and claustrophobia have been replaced with a vast open world, dotted with some of the most intricate and brutal zones the franchise has ever presented in the form of Legacy Dungeons. Out in the open world itself, you'll find yourself exploring a series of wondrous and alien environments filled with the remnants of once great civilizations, as well as a variety of World Bosses, Dungeons, Puzzles, Gear, and every assortment of goody the game has to offer.   There is a degree of repetition to this game, in that some tile sets and bosses can be a little... overused at times. However, I cannot stress the shear scope of this game. I highly recommend playing without spoiling the map, as its truly a treat to watch the world unfold.   On the same note, visually speaking, this is not the most hyper realistic game you'll ever see. However, it compensates in that it is still ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. From Soft is known for its vistas and "wow" moments, and this game takes that to a new degree by constantly making you look around in sheer wonder. From the color scheme to the world design, From Soft manages to take all the ideas that made them famous and redefine them by a golden standard.  Difficulty remains a controversial issue, but I think this is just the right difficulty. If you steamroll ahead, following the Graces and progressing the story alone, you will run into nigh insurmountable odds that will bring on a sweat for even the saltiest souls vet. However, unlike before, you have a massive area full of side content to enrich, empower, and add variety to your combat style, and it will have you tossing bombs, slinging knives, and upgrading that new sword you found in a cave to overcome these massive spikes with a natural ease that reeks of a masterpiece.  Truly, this stands next to Bloodborne and DS3 as masterclasses in the genre, but unlike those, it marks a moment of progression for the series, breaking free from several of its bonds and paving the way for even greater things to follow. Keep an eye out for the next From "Souls" game, its going to make this one look terrible.  10/10, so good I even got 100%.
العم ميزاكي ابدع
its gud
The most beautiful looking game with great story, truly one of the best.
Beautiful game, complex narrative, fun player vs. player
game good
I think it is the best of both types of games I enjoy. I love that it gives you the freedom to stand on a hill for hours or join in overwhelming odds and find a sense of accomplishment, at the end of a difficult task. This  game is full of stuff that is out to kill you. Plan to die allot. Each time you will learn something more and get a better sense of how to approach or avoid a situation, but they only are protective of their area. so you can always regroup see what else you may need to do, to be able to progress. but if you are persistent enough this game has been beat by many so you COULD go online and learn form them. or you could summon another to help lead you too. But also you can just keep playing until you figure it out on your own. then game is designed for the player to make the choice on how they want to play the game. its such an amazing mix of Skyrim, Breathe of the Wild and Dark Souls franchise games. It is worth the money.
FUCK Malenia. Good game though, highly recommend it
rump
Very gud
TLDR: Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph.  GENRE: Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game  GAMEPLAY: Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.  Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.  Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.  GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE: Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs. averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well.  STORY: The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to "order". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)  STRENGTHS: Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.  Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.  Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)  You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.  There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough  The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.  Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.  Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.  WEAKNESSES: PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens.  Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully "exit" when you quit out until a while later.  Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.  There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.  UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items  Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a "connection error" and the game boots you back to single player.  Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.  (Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.  So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).  'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power.  Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.  NUMERIC SCORE (if you care): 9.9/10; easy recommend  Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.
I hate this game.
Yea
dub game

very good game
too hard :(

IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN 5 WATERFOWL DANCES TO KILL ME MILENIA   6'll do it though  10/10 would fight the same boss for 3 and a half hours in a row again
is rile ez and fun
Such an amazing game, it definitely deserved to win game of the year.
This game is amazing. I've played over 200 hours in this game and I still find something new every time I play. This is including watching youtube videos for new builds to try out. If you're a fan of anything dark souls, I highly recommend this game.
fun but makes me want to kms 
great game. It's my first time playing a game in the Darksouls franchise and i'm thoroughly enjoying it
ah yes, the Dark Souls of Skyrim
Builds upon the Dark Souls formula in so many ways and delivers some great quality of life improvements as well as extra combat and traversal options. The 'open field' functions similarly enough to the previous games' level structure, the addition of the map is quite useful (and gorgeous). Areas are beautiful and varied, though some may say the variety detracts from an overall theme/aesthetic - DS3 nailed this thematic consistency in my opinion, which elden ring lacks a little. I had a great time with this game - until Mountaintop of the Giants, where the game became more of a slog (though still enjoyable) with later areas lacking landmarks. This game is long as hell and packed with content so you're definitely getting your money's worth.  MALENIA IS SO UNNECESSARILY HARD THERE IS NO SHAME IN SKIPPING/CHEESING HER FUCK THAT BOSS
Schritt 1: "Steffen, ich glaub das Spiel is nix für mich"  Schritt 2: "Ja gut, wenn das alle meine Freunde spielen ..."   Schritt 3: "LASER GO BRRRRRRRR~"  
When I first downloaded the game I played for 15 minutes before deleting it. A few months later I re downloaded it with new knowledge of the game. It can be overwhelming but with the internet to assist me in explaining what is what and where to go, I ended up having lots of fun. Everything offers a challenge so when you beat a boss or enemy it truly feels great. Elden Ring has a very diverse and open world to explore with many secrets. I will continue to play this game for quite awhile and it definitely earned its spot as GOTY.
Not as good as other Fromsoft's souls-like games, but still really good nonetheless.
love this game
GOOD GAME

just do me a favor and go buy it
most overrated game in existence
Allora, questa recensione farà piangere i cringioni fanboy ma infondo ci sono abituato.  Da dove iniziare?  Partiamo dal presupposto che non siamo di fronte ad un titolo divertente. Un souls-like casa From divertente? Comprensibile come domanda, ma lasciatemi spiegare:  Avendo completato chissà quante volte ormai tutta la trilogia souls, mai mi sono [/i]stancato[/i] di giocarci mid run. Certo, ci sono stati momenti di rage dovuti più che altro ad uno sviluppo fatto con il culo ma infondo pochi giochi posso vantare di essere veramente perfetti.  Dunque il problema si pone qui, l'averlo abbandonato svariate volte perché non mi stava invogliando a farlo è un bel problema, dovuta alla mancanza di un vero obbiettivo; "gne gne aiuta la frignona melinda a bruciare l'anello così salvi il mondo" (Mi ricorda l'avventura di un gruppo di gnappette ma ok).  No, darmi una mappa grossa come il Texas, piena di briciole di patatine con un'obbiettivo così generico e vago è una combo disastrosa.  Per fortuna si sono accorti che un solo finale misero come quello sarebbe stato un suicidio, così si sono messi d'accordo per farne altri e almeno Ranni risolleva un minimo la trama; sarà perché puoi interagirci, sarà perché non è criptica ma ti da delle istruzioni precise, sarà che interagirai con altri personaggi a lei legati fanno si che sia l'unico finale degno di nota.  Ora. Non che nei souls ci fosse chissà quale interazione con gli npc o una trama sfonda cervelli, ma almeno li non dovevi andare a tentoni raccogliendo briciole per capire che [/strike]minchia[/strike] fare e sopratutto dove andare. "Uhe Uhee ci sono i falò che nella mappa ti indicano dove andare Uhee", certo, una linea gialla che indica approssivamente 300 Km cubici di mappa inesplorata con all'interno 20 falò e solo uno che indica quello successivo.  Difatti il problema più grande è appunto l'eccessiva ampiezza di una mappa priva di unicità, che per renderla dinamica, hanno spammato le stesse cose da fare, semplicemente aumentando la vita dei nemici presenti. Mettermi 236 (stando alla wiki) boss non rende il gioco più bello, sopratutto se metà di questi si riciclano a vicenda, ma solamente una completition list noiosa e sopratutto toglie quel senso di pericolosità e fierezza che avevano i boss. Ormai tutto è un boss, al punto che alla fine molti di essi li ritrovi come nemici da due soldi in qualche zona più avanti.  Di conseguenza, trama banale e vaga, mappa eccessivamente grossa e priva di contenuto unico, stragrande maggioranza di boss senza una caratterizzazione e solo due elementi che si salvano: Scenari effettivamente belli, certe angolazioni del fiume Siofra sono incredibili e un gameplay fluido, ma grazie al [/strike]cazzo[/strike] è un copia e incolla di DS3 quindi funziona per forza.  Quindi in definiva, dare una sufficienza a questo titolo è impossibile, game of the year rubato aggiungerei, per un titolo che è solamente un souls open world vuoto e senz'anima, che cerca di ricalcare i passi dei suoi predecessori, aggiungendo novità ma in malo modo.  Mi dispiace per chi, toccando il suo primo souls-like, giochi a Elden Ring perché finito questo, si ritroverà senza una vera e propria conoscenza di questo genere.
not as good as ubi--soft open worlds...

if youve never played a FROM game before you might like this one! if you are a long time fan of dark souls expecting a new and exciting experience however... this game will not be satisfying. it has very few differences even in plot and tone with any of FROMs other games. i know people wanna believe the repeating themes serve some kind of purpose. it seems more like cope to me. even if it does mean something, its not any less played the fuck out! at this point its painfully formulaic. and i dont mean in the souls like genre. its for the most part the same team making the same game over and over. do the games keep taking place in empty post disaster worlds because its a stylistic choice or is it because its easy to design? after 7 different titles im thinking its the ladder.   its gameplay is dark souls. no differences whatsoever. bloodborne was unique. sekiro was unique. this has almost no improvements compared to dark souls. instead of improving anything they decided to bloat the game with meaningless and lazily designed features. crafting is practically unused because the drop rates for ANYTHING is egregious!!! The Great runes are largely meaningless and their effects are abysmal for the effort of finding and climbing the right tower. 10% more max hp is as good as it gets. it feels like they quickly jammed this stuff in just to advertise it as a feature instead of actually making it a feature.   the open world is the emptiest and loneliest world i have ever been in. NOTHING HAPPENS! EVER! it rains and fucks over your fire damage occasionally. THATS IT!! the only things of any note are all right in the beginning. the giant dropping from the arch overhead. agheal swooping down. the carian rain of arrows. all the stuff youve already seen in trailers. it is somehow an open world game where every single run is the exact same. nothing different happens.   the npcs are cardboard. they never move. and if they do its between resting at graces. they will say everything in cringy and cryptic ways and basically tell you to go somewhere without any directions. in later patches there is a marker automatically placed where you need to go. was it really so hard for blaidd to say WHERE the comet hit? i wouldve settled for simply "where we first met." but nah. theres now an unmarked hole somewhere. go find it. i wouldnt complain about getting lost if the world were at all interesting. this game feels like im a dumb little kid again playing a roblox fan game on an empty server. the enemies are pathetic and easy. its not even worth killing for how little runes anything drops besides bosses. its so boring.  which reminds me. this game of the year game has the Worst multiplayer in existence. how hard was it to do what the seamless co op mod does? if you want to progress the game with a friend you have to beat each area per player. while getting invaded by another player. why is there no option to AT LEAST prevent invasions? i dont care about this games roblox tier pvp leave me alone! if i could at least complete one area with another player without getting harassed by a pack of ego maniacal neckbeards playing dress up. this review whould be a touch more positive. but dear christ win or lose, you and your friends are getting hatemail. oh you thought league of legends was toxic and un fun? just wait till you make the mistake of winning against an invader. nothing is more persistant than a PvPer with a hurt ego. youll never see or hear the last of them till they invade again and win or have threatened and called you every insult and slur in existance. holy shit its bad.   balance is downright nonsense. i had so much fun actually playing sorcerer for once. and then my whole world crumbled when i found the glintstone kris... the sorcery Comet is the single strongest projectile in the game fully charged it costs 24 fp to cast. glint stone kris is a dagger that just fires a STRONGER FASTER VERSION of Comet for 10 fucking fp!?!? that pretty much destroys any reason to use spells outside of specific uses. this isnt the only case of weapons arts blowing spells out of the game. lightning incantations are pretty good! but out damaged by weapon art versions of spells. its INSANITY how bad this design choice is. the only reason to use them is because it looks cool. thats IT!  i try so hard finding a good fun way to be proud of a run. thats a problem with this games erratic difficulty. i wont argue that the game is to hard or easy because its neither. IT IS BROKEN! bosses are either impossible or trivial depending on your playstyle for instance. if your plan is to do the classic swing swing damage strat. you are sure to beleive that this game is hard. thats because boss IA is reading your inputs and even your queued inputs including rolling and flasks. even worse, bosses are able to cancel attacks or animations with eachother. this combination of mechanics basically creates bosses who truly NEVER STOP ATTACKING. if you keep rolling the boss will keep trying to quickly punish it by starting a new attack string. if you dodge that he will just do it againagain until it lands a hit thus actually letting it continue its intended attack string. every death in this game can be summed up with "oh i thought they were done." some bosses are able to cancel their own hitstun! yeah thats insanely broken! theres another weird interaction where sometimes if you poise break a boss while its attacking it will suddenly be doing the attack when they recover. for instance. falling star beasts charge can be interupted by hitting it in the head. letting you get some hits in. but when it gets up it will suddenly resume the charge full speed with no warnings. commander niall has a massive Aoe attack that he has to charge up first. if you break his stance during the charge up and reposte him. after he gets back up he will suddenly be doing his massive Aoe with you stood right next to him. there is no way this is intended game design! theres broken shit like this but also the player can just use any straight sword and spam square off the entire game. AND THAT WORKS! margit will have his poise broken after 2 uses. this game is such a fuckin mess!!! AND IT GOT GAME OF THE YEAR wtf!? this only scratches the surface of shit thats wrong.  this game is carried so hard by everyone's hype.  its really just a $60 roblox experience with somehow worse PvP.   for the love of god start criticizing games again people! just because miyazaki and martin made it doesnt mean its automatically good. no game should be exempt from actual criticism in the way this game has been for the last year. like seriously guys. fanboys praise this game for shit done in the 90s. wowies it took over 10 years to program horses. is this just a big joke im not a part of or something?

Fun game. I enjoy the challenge. I'm playing offline because I don't feel like dealing with other players trying to ruin the game for people who are early in the game by using end game gear. It happened when I had it on ps4, so I'm not dealing with it this time.
this game throws everything but the kitchen sink at you.
Good fucking game finished it 3 times already.

punishing but amazing and adicting <3
this game is so much fun!
I played DS1 years ago on PS3. Tried DS2, DS3, and BB, and they never really clicked for me, so at first I ignored Elden Ring, despite hearing a lot of good things about it from friends. Eventually I watched some game play and was intrigued enough that I figured I'd give it a go, and an amazing friend of mine bought it for me for my birthday. I. AM. HOOKED. This game is so fun and rewarding to play. You can even play together with friends with the seamless CO-OP mod, although I would recommend playing it by yourself first. The feeling you get when you get your ass handed to you, and you come back later and smack that foe upside their head, is so gratifying. The atmosphere and aesthetics are superb, and the combat is fluid. I haven't beaten it yet, but it's definitely feeling like my GotY, despite getting it only a little over a week ago.
Held a Walmart™ hostage with my $3 Whopper™ for this game. Worth
you need this game in your life..... also where's the next grace?!?!?!
good 
Weak foe ahead
Great game, lots of content
Perfect
It is as good as people say, get it!
its fine
BEST GAME EVER ITS HARD BUT ITS VERY FUN 10/10
it will haunt you dreams
seems like decent game
Honestly, I consider this a perfect game. Open world done well. Fights are tough but not impossible. You feel you deserved the win. Fixes everything I disliked about Dark Souls games. The first time exploring is exhilarating and addictive. Literally have no idea what you'll find when you turn a corner. Could be a dragon, a mushroom man, or a T-rex proportioned dog-thing. Highly recommend if you enjoy a good action RPG that will absorb hours of your day.
Best game ever
three words....       W O R K      O F      A R T
Any game seem tarnished compared to Elden Ring.
this is a very hard game and despite it´s flaws like scuffed camera angels it is a refreshing and difficult experience that i would recomend for anny hardcore gamers willing to try it (it´s also probably the best souls/soulslike game to start with, it was my first and i loved i. i´m writing this 100 hours in on the first 6-8 days of haveing it.)
Buy this game. RN!!!
great game
gud
Hands down best souls game
Genshin but in minor key.   10/10
Elden Ring is one of From Software's most polished pieces of work. From music, to atmosphere, to compelling characters, and on top of that all; gameplay that is both challenging and immensely rewarding. Throughout the years I have played many of this style of game, and Elden Ring has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had.  If you are someone who likes to throw yourself at something and watch failure after failure until you succeed, this game is for you. That feeling after finally defeating a boss you have been struggling with for hours and hours is something that very few games can replicate.  After 140 Hrs, and still more to come, I fully believe that if you are interested in this game, you should buy it and play.
Maidenless
And so, we inhabit a fractured world. Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord. Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown? Masterpiece 10/10 -Axxarius Axx
This is the best RPG so far. Difficulty is based on build.
HONESTLY the best game ive played in years so fun but challlenign
very nice
Amazing game, if you enjoy challenge and possess ANY pattern recognition skills you will have a great time.
game changed my life
simply the greatest
depression is bad but pair it with this and you will have a even worse time  10/10 would recommend
I LOVE HOW ANGRY THIS GAME MAKES ME. GOD I LOVE THE RAGE BREWING INSIDE ME AS I LOAD UP ELDEN RING
I love this game
Behold, Dog!
vision of lover therefore offer seed.
GIGA CHAD GAME
Love it. Worth every single penny. It took me 206 hours to get all achievevments. Considering its 60 eur, it's like 30 cents per hour of fun, and oh boi, it is fun :)  The only downsides is that as a souls game, you can cheese a bit too much. Also you can get lost in the open world, skip shit, disable questlines etc. Therefore, in your first playthroughs you will keep looking for guides, which might not be a downside for some but whatever.
Best game I've played in over 2 decades.
7/10 play ds3 instead.  You will be killed by stuns more than anything in this game.  
waste of my damn time but i love it
most stunning Rpg title from fromsoftware worth playing it.
why is it always a MASTERPIECE
rot
Dark souls, but easy.
Very Hard and unforgiving game, but when you finally beat a boss you spent probably at least an hour on the feeling is unimaginable. It gives you beyond a feeling of accomplishment. But yes it is a very hard and challenging game but it keeps me entertained.
good
i liked when the antagonist (elden ring) said their classic catchphrase "its might morbin elden ring time"
pickle
Its been my first souls like. I love that I am not getting babyed, but have the chance to explore everything on my own. I've by now several play throughs. And I am still loving it; experimenting with my own builds as well as with those other players came up with. The graphic looks great, the story is worth exploring, the mechanics are easy to understand. It became fun, when i recongnized dying is not an evil thing in a game.
nice

i hate this game so much
Welp, I completed some AAA games for the past few months. Thought I was at least a decent casual player.   Boy, how wrong I was.   I am still struggling at the Tree Sentinel....  edit: just realized you are not supposed to fight Tree Sentinel right off the bat.....
Amazing Gameplay, quite fast. Maybe between Bloodborne and Darksouls 3
I'ts a fantastic game with a ton of things to discover. The map is gorgeous the fights are fair but really hard all around one of my favorite games. please do yourself a favor and get this game it's worth the time investment to learn the mechanics of each boss
Masterpiece that brings the best and worst of you.
Forefathers, one and all... bear witness!!!

as a new fromsoftware gamer i would say for early and new player this game is soooo horrible then you get to the point that your build actually works and make big damage  man this game is just 10/10 good world,open world feeling , all different vibes interesting npcs and bosses  just it really do be GOTW worthy
very nice
welcome tarnished
Its good,  way too easy...
My gripes with this game run deep.  Starting with the console style gaming.  I play PC for a reason... keyboard and mouse primarily.  Being forced to play where a controller design is intended is very annoying to me.  The game world is vast, and beautiful, and fun to explore.  Enemies look interesting.  The atmosphere is great.  Those are the only pluses I would attribute to Elden Ring.  Combat ruins the game however, in my opinion.  The camera control is lousy and locked targets will switch mid-combat to targets you are not even engaged with.  It is always fun fighting an enemy directly in front of you and having the camera rotate 180 degrees because it randomly locks some enemy behind you.  At that point, you are still facing and fighting the front enemy but with the camera spinning, missing all your attacks, and not even knowing which way is up or down after the vertigo the game puts you through.  Every fight is painful and it is not because of how the enemy fights most of the time, but rather, it is because of how lousy the controls are with keyboard and mouse.  I also believe in fair combat for games, with a decent AI.  Elden Ring is anything but this.  Once you start going into boss fights, all they do is stay on you with either their 10x speed movement, or jump onto you from the other side of the arena.  Your character is very sluggish in comparison.  Not only is enemy boss movement at super speed, but they do not have status bars themselves, other than HP, so they spam boss abilities.  To me, I find it to be a cheaty and lousy AI.  It's not really about tactics but more about learning the rotations and timings.  The AI is just not good.  A lot of people say "git gud" but I think that should be directed at these companies for not developing any kind of decent AI in these games and just going with the same old worn-out model every single time.  This game feels like a step backwards.  Instead of meaningful combat, this game is all about timing that dodge roll.  I find it sad that games have not progressed beyond parkour and the dodge roll. >.>
I like it therefore I shall put a ring on it.
I am the Elden Lord
try finger but hole
it won game of the year for a good reason 10/10
yes
This may be my favorite open world game ever. The combat is challenging but really fun, the world is immense, with loads of things to do, and the visuals are stunning. It's certainly frustrating, and I nearly broke my keyboard a couple of times but it is totally worth it. The armor and weapons are super cool, with tons of detail and different styles. One thing I didn't like about it was that you could very easily miss the chance to complete a quest or get some cool loot, and you would often receive instructions from an NPC and have no idea what to do next, but the lack of a clear guide is part of the game. All in all, super fun. 10/10

cmon man that's too easy
First soul games i tried and i was amazing you should get it and you wont regret it trust
One of the best games I've ever played!
Yeah, it's ight
WORST GAME EVER DO NOT PLAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLAY FOR OVER 50 hours just to receive a error than makes you lose $110 buying the game.
very fun and great open world
its ight
Elden Ring is a masterpiece of a game.  I've thoroughly enjoyed every boss and sub-boss encounter.  The landscapes of the different regions offer beautiful scenery and probably more so with high end pc components. Elden Ring offers many weapon choices for players who enjoy melee to magic, quality to hybrids; you'll be busy with this souls like gaming experience.  When you think you're finished with a quest or simple exploration, you'll be surprised at the depth of how far the game will go.  Elden Ring's world is huge, I can only imagine what a DLC can offer.  Even if you purchase this game at full price, you won't be disappointed, but even I waited for a discount.  Enjoy the exploration and accidental encounters, put your headphones on or crank up the speakers; either way, have fun in this wonderful and mysterious world.
Great but hole
gopod!
How is one man supposed to have enough time to dedicate 2 playthroughs when there is so much swag to collect  The lands between more like, The pants i've creamed, because there are 100+ pants in this game
Not really a fan of the open world format but I would have to lie to say that this game isn't impressive af. Just the requirements alone are amazing, with not a frame dropped during some of the most intense particle flinging fights in the game. I'd give it a 8/10
Absolutely incredible.
dog good
have fun dying
Seriously one of the greatest games ever made. It's all I think about and I think I have a problem.
Great game, stunning graphics and comabat experience.

I want to love this game more but with the performance issues i just cant. without third party software (which means i cannot play with friends on this game in the future because of anti cheat software)  it runs 50 - 40 on low graphics with specs amd ryzen 9 5900x nvidia 3080 32gb of ram  ssd for the game of course but still runs shit  but besides performance this game is awesome 7/10 without third software,  9/10 with software
this game
You know when you read a fantastic book series that evokes your imagination? You know when those books are sometimes super detailed to really drive in the importance of normally small or mundane things? Tolkien kind of does that. Have you ever seen a movie that draws you in with its presentation, the way certain images have a symbolic power and presence the way a great painting does?  Combine these two, and make it into a game where you can walk around such a detailed setting constructed by layers of context and themes and symbols, and you have Elden Ring. It's a game about many things: overcoming hardship, rejection of a corrupt status quo, beautiful sights and exploration, wicked monsters and fantastic characters, and it's also about family and tragedy. It's about many more things, too. What makes Elden Ring great is that, like many FromSoft games, you don't have to pay close attention to the story to keep the game interesting. To play is fine on its own. But the storytelling--which really means "presentation of the setting" in this context--of Elden Ring is exceptional, it is simply art. There is much to gawk at, to consider, to discover, to converse over, to love and to hate. Elden Ring can be played fast and intensely, or slowly and thoroughly. Elden Ring can be tackled as a gamer, or as a historian. Or both, if you are so bold, or at least as invested as I am. I have 700 hours in this game as of right now. It is a phenomenal mark in the history of games--proof that a video game can be as deep, powerful, evocative as the works of Tolkien.    I think that to consider things like "bullshit attacks" or "poor pvp balancing" or "recycled use of content" as detractors of the game to the point where it affects judgment of the piece as a whole, would be like seeing a few typos or different spellings of the same character's name in a great book and then saying the whole book is lesser for having those 'mistakes'. It would be ignoring the purpose or importance of what the piece accomplishes--the book could have the literal best narrative possible but because it has spelling mistakes, you put it aside. That's stupid; it has nothing to do with what the piece is about. Such is the case with Elden Ring. Gameplay, here, is not the number one priority for being the best part of the piece. That is why I think Elden Ring is a 10/10, literal masterpiece.
kewl
eleven hours in. when is it supposed to get fun? i know that the appeal of this franchise is that the games are absolutely brutal towards the player, but at a certain point it just gets straight up unfair. grinding for 10 hours just to beat the first story boss feels really demotivating, since that puts a thought in my mind that i'm going to have to do the same thing for all of the other bosses, or sit on my ass trying to beat it for 5 hours. the only bosses that should take that long are ones that are only there if the player wants that challenge. and the open world aspect is really overwhelming. its almost impossible to tell where some dungeons, items and quests are without having to look at a guide. and even then, you don't even know what you're supposed to be looking for half of the time.
good
10/10
this is the most annoying, obnoxious, maddening game I have ever played   I love it
GO-TED
yay
What a great game, fantastic bosses and magnificent world, highly recommend !!!
In my 74 hours playing this game I have witnessed a masterpiece. So magnificent that it's the first game I've gotten the platinum for. The game makes you go from a maidenless runt to the Elden Lord. This is what a game should truly be.
good game

Alright guess I haven't written a review for this game so I will now. Absolutely no complaints for the singleplayer experience, except the quests are hard to track and npcs hard to find. The co-op is alright, but I wish it was more fluid, like the seamless co-op mod. If you're looking for just the singleplayer experience this game is a must have. Now we get into the pvp. The servers are absolutely terrible. People can go from relatively decent connection to levitating towards you in a idle position, sometimes spells hit you before the cast animation even plays. The arena matchmaking is terrible, long and inconsistent wait times, and it just randomly gets cancelled by the game. Weapons are also very unbalanced. Overall 9/10 for the singleplayer experience and 6/10 for the pvp experience.
GOTY all the time every time.
This game is easy dont let people lie to you.
Fantastic game! Huge world to ex[lore. Can be hard at times but will reward you if you have patients & determination. Struggled with 1 particular boss (I'm sure you know who) but once I brought out the tank armour & big bonk hammer it was a breeze. Solid 9/10! P.S. Fuck Malenia
Damn this shit was good!

Great game! I have played for over 200 hours on my Xbox and it is my favorite game by far! The only problem that I have is the multiplayer feature, you are able to summon a friend and they are able to help you in boss fights or with roaming around that area. But you are unable to go into a different area unless they leave the game and join back in said area. Other than that however, amazing game and I will be playing it for years to come!
Age of fracture: Ending is 6/10  Age of the Duskborn: Ending is 10/10, Tight hug  Age of the Stars: 7/10, Not my type.  Blessing of Despair: Ending is 4/10, Dung eater is a douche.  Age of Order: Ending is 5/10, Screw order.  Lord of Frenzied Flame: Ending, I'm starting to hate fingers, 0/10, I literally got a punishment for winning in this ending, Bruh.  Overall the endings work in Tandem. I'm impressed the endings, together are a solid 8/10 for me. Only slightly repetitive.
Just finished my first playthrough of the game, fully recommend this game to anyone wanting to try out a FromSoftware game. This was the first of which that I had ever played, and it has left a strong first impression. I didn't expect to be able to run the game on high graphics and get smooth FPS, but I'll be damned. The scenery is a sight to behold and the NPCs alongside it just make the game so dynamic. Despite some of the bosses being hard and, sometimes, tedious to fight, they're still enjoyable to go against and the feeling of achievement after beating them is very fulfilling. This game has a very good replay value to the point where I'm content with starting a new build to try out other challenges or endings, or even to see if I had missed out on major quests or bosses since there is a LOT to this game.  Definitely money well-spent.

can a game win GOTY twice?
 You know what you are getting into with a game like this so I won't talk about the combat or anything. The lore is AMAZING and the world is fantastic, definitely play this. I wasn't too sold on the multi player at first but its actually really fun as well, and makes boss fights pretty enjoyable. I mean what else can I say, its GOTY for a reason...

I am closing in on 50 hours in this game and i am no where near done with the story. This games awesome graphics, game play, world, and many other things make this game 100% worth the expensive 60$. I love this game and it deserved Game of the year just as much as God of War Ragnarok. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in gaming. Definitely in top 5 video games and that has come from someone who has played lots of video games.

I actually have over 700+ hours on this game on console, but i bought it again on pc.
because fun
Gaming
best game ever 
Masterpiece
One of the only games I would want to re-experience for the first time again. Truly an amazing game. Have replayed three times now (2 solo and 1 with co-op mod) and I have yet to try faith, so I'll most likely replay the game again for a 4th time. Highly recommend, esp if it's your first "souls-like" game. I honestly have not ever been excited about any games or felt interested in much other games in the past few years and thought I was just getting old, but this really reminded me why I enjoyed video games so much. Just go for it!
Its not going to be easy but it will be fair (mostly). There will be times when you want to call it quits, but you say screw it, one more try. In this last final attempt for the evening, you accomplish your goal and the whole game looks easy all of the sudden. But lets be real, you didn't get your goal, you're gonna die another 75x before you get it. Get this game if your life is quiet and docile. Don't get this game if you're prone to physical violence when you don't get your way. Now get out there and get face fisted by the Tree Sentinel like the rest of us.
i mean, who doesnt love this?
ive played through the game over 6 times now, i have 1200 hours i cant get back. i love fromsoftware but these bosses fucking suck. i spend most of my time now messing around next to a site of grace just trying differnt armor and ashes. it was fun in the first half then went downhill rapidly. im happy fromsoft got a goty, but it shouldnt of been from this. this was the game my friends associated me with, you shouldve seen their faces when i told them not to buy it. the feeling of keeping my friends clear of this bullshit felt good. they watched me fight maliketh and unanimously swore off fromsoft. i wont be returning, thanks friends hope this helps.

Decided to take the plunge despite bouncing off Dark Souls and the like and hearing how hard Elden Ring was. Well, don't let that put you off. It wasn't a cakewalk, but just doing everything in the game without grinding levelled me sufficiently that nothing caused me too much trouble. 140 hours I think I saw everything (no appetite for New Game+), I'm sure I never actually "got good", but I did at least learn a little patience instead of button mashing constantly.  The game was very good, but I won't go so far as to say it's personal GOTY material, nor one of the best open world games I've played. It was sufficiently different to keep me interested. There is lore there, if you're willing to hunt for it. Much like the game's systems, there is a distinct lack of explanation or direction. Life's too short: I used a wiki. :P
i came 
Absolutely fantastic game, some of the best exploration, narrative and thematic cohesion, and build variety i've ever seen. However: if you're looking forward to the bosses, don't buy this game. the vast majority of bosses in this game are repeats, including even major story encounters, and towards the endgame these encounters become such a slog that at time of this review, i have no intent to finish the game. Go check out Sekiro instead: its combat is designed to actually allow you to FIGHT the bosses instead of standing there and watching them kill you with no real enjoyable way to fight back.

Additionally, the soundtrack is awesome, an epic one, [*][h3]Negatives[/h3] On the side of negatives, I will point out the bad optimization, which includes many FPS drops, low FPS, and unusually random crashes, provoking a less enjoyable experience. Lastly, some bosses where really repetitive, mostly the dungeon bosses. [/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2] Elden Ring it's an awesome game, that improves mechanically on many aspects of the previous games with incredible world building, but it has a bad optimization with some repetitive enemies. Despite all that, the game is an 8.75/10.
i love the game i wish there was a harder difficulty.
game really good, much love
Great game never ending content
I think I developed a phobia for jumping naked women 10/10
Really good but goddamn this game was a commitment.
great game
genuinely the best game ive played
fun

Art.
good game
Elden Ring is the first Souls game I’ve ever played and it has immediately become the best video game I have ever played.  By far.
Elder ring
yes
peak
it alright
Painfully hard at times and could use better multiplayer but beautiful and riveting.
Ambasing
Its good
Best game I've ever played! All the worlds are so creative and interesting, with tons of enemies, items, weapons and quests to do. The bosses are always a challenge but that's how it is with From Soft games, but it makes the experience just that more rewarding. Everyone needs to play this game!
hope you like death cause youre goingdie... like a lot...wellllll,Enjoy!!!
pp
I almost broke my keyboard while playing.
10/10. The game makes you feel like you've been transported into a painting. If the difficulty is what is keeping you from getting this game, don't let it. The game isn't as difficult as people make it out to be and there are plenty of ways to cheese everything. If you like medieval fantasy, this is a must-have. There's a reason why this was game of the year in 2022.
For the sake of atmosphere and beauty, I started playing Elden Ring. Worthy adventure for creative people and not only. Very beautiful visual style, The game gave me a lot of inspiration. The castle of Azure Liurnia is my reverence. A very magical place that brought me aesthetic pleasure. There were also many other locations bewitching with their beauty. Art is something individual, but I think that in this game everyone will find something for themselves that they will like.
Though I enjoy the gameplay and the discovery of the experience there are far too many times where the game presents 'options' that are unclear and purposefully obtuse. There are also various times where the game logic surrounding NPCs, death, and mechanical rules are inconsistent. Lastly, I dislike how many character stories are not explained, though much lore is hidden behind dialogue and items there are outcomes that are unexplained and even wikis seem to be lost as to why the outcome occurs. After multiple playthrus and 200hrs this has left a poor taste in my mouth.
GREAT FUCKING GAME !! 
This game is pretty poggers
Quite nice and should play in a room that has nothing that can break
Don't know really the lore but ik Ranni can get it
good
First time to not recommend a From Software Game and even though I had my fair share of fun in it I cannot simply give it a thumbs up. Elden Ring has proved itself to be a huge disappointment and in many areas even a shitshow, especially from the PVP side of things.  here is a list of things that don't sit well with me:  - too much unbalanced and broken stuff geared towards the casual players that can use that to insta-kill without any skill needed for execution. All thanks to the needy-greedy content creators on youtube the game is at all times infested by users of the same OP shit. -Implementing jumping along with jumping attacks was a huge mistake for pvp. They are way too safe with added i-frames, deal too much damage and don’t cost much stamina. Especially terrible on dual curved sword users with bleed that hit 4 times in one jump. - Fighting system resolves around jump attacks, weapon art spam and whatever else broken mechanics the game currently has to offer to make a casual feel like a god without any skill requirement whatsoever. A nightmare when facing ganks. - Huge lack of variety in movesets between weapons.  - Lots of movesets part are redundant. It was so nice to see additional moves and maneuvers, but you quickly notice after a while that a lot of them are pointless. I also really missed the heavy chain continuity pattern after a roll from DS3 in which you would actually do the second attack right away and not the first that you would do from neutral. - Invasions are incredibly host favored with them having all their flasks and on top of that at least one or two friends with them. Single hosts can only be invaded if they specifically >invite< invaders... -_- - Invading near/far is good, but getting back your runes is a drag, especially since the marker on the map is easily overseeable.  - Implementing sneaking was nice, but being able to spam it and hence teabag other people only promotes toxicity (some people are even so lazy that they use it for bowing smh). - Shallow implementation. You can just run past everything. Nothing ever really stands in your way except very few gate keeper bosses. There is no reason to actually fight the creatures around you - none whatsoever. The world is empty and shallow. Exploring solitary sites seldomly bears anything as reward.  - Late game areas are poorly designed and don't provide anything really worthwhile for exploring. - ng+ and beyond is pointless unless you need a specific item that you missed in a quest or that you want to have a second time. - bosses are ridiculously easy when fighting in a group. Since you can also summon spirits you can make it also incredibly easy offline. - Boss design is nowhere near DS3 level  (which were challenging, fun and had incredible soundtrack). Some bosses are lackluster and bring in unfair mechanics to raise the difficulty artificially. The final bosses are all terrible in that regard. Beatable sure, but no fun fight really. Other bosses are usually just copy pasta variants of what you have fought before. There are actually only quite a few unique bosses. The OSTs of the bosses is not really noteworthy. Radagon’s fight theme is the only memorable and great piece (as it is basically the main theme).  - Terrible camera that will get you killed. For instance when close to walls or when facing giant/gigantic foes (looking at you fire giant!)  - Most players get items duped from the getgo which destroys any early game natural balances the game originally had. Nothing has been done on that front – ever. - High level players with late game equipment are often summoned and act like guard dog on steroids. Downleveling does not work well in this game at all. Damage-wise they melt anything in their way. GG From Soft... - when you die to a night opponent you have to set the day time to night everytime AND sit at the site of grace again to them spawn again. So much wasted time. - Overall unfortunately the replayability of this game is scarce. Too much copy pasta content (lots of sekiro stuff including OSTs too), too many lackluster obstacles, too few actual rewards that give incentive to proceed to ng+   This is the first From Software Game I am not sure whether or not I actually would want to buy the DLC if released.
10/10
best open world game
Buy this game. Be warned you will want to kill the nearest living creature numerous times whilst playing this game. Great game tho, like one of the best I've ever played.
Highly recommend this game 1000/10. The game is great in every way. From fighting, to cutscenes, to storyline. If you are scared to pay the money just pay trust me you will have so much fun! Remember, there will be a grind though.
As someone who has never played, let alone beaten, a Fromsoft game and never thought I would be able to, this wonderful piece of art is as good as games get. I was terrified of trying Elden Ring because I thought I would play it for 3 hours get frustrated and never play it again. But it just sucks you in, when you get stuck you can just go a different direction do 100 other things on the way.   I beat this game and so can you and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
love it
great game

top 10 best story games ive ever played

Good
Still no maiden, therefore Elden Ring
John Eldenring did a phenomenal job creating this game
This game, although hard, is worth both the money and the time.
Big open world. Lots of content. Fun bosses.
Frame rate drops are miserable even on high end system. Will wait for an update before I try to play a game this hard. Asked for refund and denied.
Great stuff
fire giant :vomit:
absolute perfection
One of the best games I have ever played.
game of all time
dark souls??????
12/10 - absolutely mind-blowing
It's a great time! Though I highly recommend the COOP Mod for seemless multiplayer (If you plan on playing with friends), it makes the game 100% better!
Horrifyingly bad. Awful story, awful combat system, awful enemies and awful weapons.  My least favourite game of all time
Meeting the first NPC. Getting called Maidenless. Kills him cuz no one calls you Maidenless. Game gets a bit harder.
Yeah this game is great but the godskin duo can smd
man this is so good 
top 5 game of all time no cap
good game
 I was never into souls games but I have to say the scale of the world it self kept me coming back. I've put 255 hours and a lot of those were just exploring. Even during the last couple of days playing I was still discovering new areas and mini bosses. To me, the game is a symbolic representation of depression. Your ability to overcome seemingly impossible odds the more and more you play carries you through out the vast world you were dropped into. Despite the grandeur of the world you journey through, the lack of people and the sense of isolation also become a sub-textual foe. This game has taught me that no matter your skill, you previous experience or, your enjoyment over current circumstances: your mental fortitude is a key instrument to persevere throughout life. In conclusion, I was never good at these types of games, to be fair i am still not, but i feel as though through each impossible task i grew a little more.
amazing
Game of the year for good reason.
been a long time since RPG was done right. its a must buy for rpg fans even if you dont enjoy souls like games. i hope other game devs would take note.
Don't let the difficulty hype discourage you. This is just a common RPG game minus the quest markers and journals, quick saves, and tutorials. Like any other RPG, you'll die if you play it like an action FPS. Pay attention to your surroundings and you'll do fine. There is tons of info online to get you going if you want to start the game off easy or if you need more info about anything in the game. I didn't feel like any of the game mechanics were poorly implemented or frustrating, it actually plays very well, at least with a gamepad. I fought all of the optional story or shard bearer bosses and only one of them was a major pain. I didn't 100% the game, but completed various dungeons, cleared the underground areas, and explored much of the overworld area; completed all that in 120 hours.  Never had the game crash or consistently stutter, its main issue is that it is single-threaded. It will try to use all of one CPU core, so it seems like it might briefly lock if something else wants to use that CPU core, but that might have happened 3-4 times for me. I played with an i7-9700K + RTX3090 and the game ran smooth 99.999% of the time. The game may briefly stutter after updating video drivers, I assume it's compiling shaders, but that seems to go away within a minute.  From is basically the Japanese version of Bethesda, they've been building on the same engine for an eternity, stamping out cookie-cutter games running on newer iterations of that engine, so don't expect an audio/visual masterpiece. The art design looks good, but isn't cutting edge, and the audio is alright, but don't expect a fabulous hi-fi experience. The game world is interesting and gameplay is fun.
might be the best game i ever played ngl
I usually play this with the seamless multiplayer mod with one of my friends, but solo is good too. I only have like 3.9 hours on it right now, but i can 100% see myself having a couple hundred at some point. It's rather fun but quite confusing which is why I recommend the mod, unless you have no friends of course, which is common amongst the average Elden Ring player.
its amazing
The game refuses to open, I have been trying for 2 hours reinstalled the game and nothing works. Every time I open it my screen turns black and it crashes.
I hate a chimcken sandwich today :)
good
Other than frustrating platforming especially in that one underground area after a boss, this is a really great game. The story is light if you do not comb through each item description/npc dialogue/environment clues, but honestly it is probably not the reason why you would play a souls game. Combat, builds, leveling up and the immersive world is top tier. Even if you have not played a souls game before, I think you should give this a go.
very good
Nice Game
I am the elden lord fuck uou i best ranaldi !
Fun at peak
I have to first mention that i like to call myself a "souls-veteran". I have played every souls game except Demon s souls and completed them several times! (DS, DS2, DS3, Sekiro, Bloodborne, Elden Ring). I know what im getting myself into when playing these types of gamer or "souls-likes" as you would call them.   Now onto the game itself, i have to say that since this is a souls game it is NOT for everyone, and you WILL die over and over and over until you finally beat that piece of s*** that killed you all those times (looking at you Malenia). That is the formula of these games, you die several times until you memorize the enemy s attacks and get a better chance at beating them.   But i must also say that even though this is a souls game, in my personal opinion it is a good game for new players to the series, as you are not forced to fight everything you stumble upon. You can choose to fight that particular enemy over and over for several hours or you can decide to explore somewhere else, and come back later as this is the first time a souls game has gone full Open-World.   In terms of gameplay there is a lot of different options for players, you can for example use a staff and deal magic damage from long range or choose to summon a FREAKING DRAGON HEAD to spew fire or frost or poison atyour enemies! You can choose to be a big burly warrior with a big a** sword, or you can choose to be more agile and dual wield katanas.  Without spoiling anything too much for new players i have to say that the world is absolutely AMAZING, and the colors can range from pretty and green to red and downright terrifying. (people who has played the game know what i mean by RED and TERRIFYING).   The only complains i have is that the endgame is BULLS*** as enemies deal WAY too much damage, and can also take quite a few hits even with the best weapons and equipment in your arsenal. And the game can stutter in some areas quite often.  In summary, i think Elden Ring is a fantastic game from the genius mind of Hidetaka Miyusaki, and i reccomend people try this game!  I give this game a score of 9/10
fort,night?
This game is a must play for anyone who loves open world games
it good
this game made me actually do something when i was doing nothing in life

Meh Bosses.
Love it!
WHY CANT I SEX MELINA!!!!!
I have played this game for about 150 hours and still am just trying to figure out how to make it work on mouse and keyboard. This game is only for controller players. Even if you play on controller, you will still be locked at 60 fps. The graphics may look good on console, but if you closely at anything the immersion factor will go out the window. Why is there platforming in a game where my character dodge rolls every time I sprint? Why is there platforming in a game with the worst movement mechanics in all of history???? Oh no I walked to close to a wall and my camera had a seizure and made me jump off the edge for the 1000th time. This definitely feels like skyrim in the aspect of the modding community made the game rather than the actual named developers (With all the cheesing of the bosses and other glitches). If you are on mouse and keyboard and find a way to make it not change targets with moving the mouse, please for the love of God let me know. The biggest challenge in this game isn't the enemies you face, it is battling the clunky mechanics the game forces on you. That enemy went behind a tree so we gonna lock you off of him and make u face some random direction. Oh you wanna lock back onto him? Boom, another random direction of the camera and not the direction of the enemy by any means. I could go on and on, but there are just some examples.
I played this game on the PS4 and got plat trophies, sunk over 400 hours into this beauty of a game. From the scenery, dialog down to the horrors - This game is simply ethereal. If you're wanting a game where you can sink into it for hours on end and lose yourself, and a fan of falling in love for witch women. Give it a go.   10/10 would marry Ranni again.
Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn, Die, spawn,
Absolutely incredible game. Enthralled me from start to finish. The sheer build possibility and richness of the world make this game stand alone from the rest of the Soulsborne saga. Is it BETTER than any other FromSoft game? It's hard to say. Will the open-world gameplay be something I will miss dearly if the developers go back to linear installments? Yes. Absolutely.
I didn't think I would enjoy this game, but I love it. I love logging in and wandering for hours just exploring the world. If you like a challenge and exploring to figure things out then this game will not disappoint.
Try Finger But Hole.
Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games. Where in previous titles you followed a general path to success, Elden RIng allows you multiple avenues and tools to navigate. This game drew from the successful gameplay of Dark Souls III while implementing the scenic styles of all Soulsborne titles.  This allowed it to be incredibly diverse in design, where enemy and landscape appearances drew heavily from Elden Ring's predecessors. All in all an absolute must play game.
Its fun 
Souls-like game but open world. very nice.
All of the fuss around this game was totally deserved. Enternaining and challenging altogether.
the annoying to satisfying/fun ratio is about 70/30.  tedious.
The game is very fun,but I wish the devs could already fix the weird bug,that causes me to cry everytime when Fia hugs me.
If your into PAIN, PC crashes, keybind PC nightmare, graphics glitches and just all around misery, then by all means buy this POS....
blaidd
sekiro better
gud
My first playthrough was easily the most fun singleplayer experience I've ever had.
best game i have ever played
Good Ring
fun
Good gaem.

You don't have the right.
NEVER HAD SO MUCH FREAKING FUN
so gooooood
Awesomesauce
very cool game must play good for a first souls game
very good game
door does not open from this side
horse != dragon
The GOAT
Deserving of game of the year
I mean, its Elden Ring.   This game checks all the boxes: Intricate character customization Great weapon and armor aesthetics Beautiful World Fantastic story line NPCs have character depth Actually challenging Rewards exploration  In my opinion this games world is so full of places to explore that actually feel rewarding. A lot of games I play these days while still being good games have left me feeling as though the worlds themselves are empty regardless of how open they may be. In Elden Ring I feel there is constantly something new to find or something that I passed up on a previous play through. That alone is enough to keep me playing the game for hours, I definitely feel like I have gotten my money's worth. I have logged 900 hours on playstation as well as these 153 on PC. after the work they put into it on PC it runs much better and I encounter very little issues.   If I really had to pick something to list as a con (and this is some deep nit picking) I suppose it would be the grass rendering. On PC it can feel as though it pops up aggressively and suddenly, and this doesn't seem to change regardless of any tinkering with the settings. That being said, it's by no means a game breaker. Elden Ring for me is a 10/10.
Just remember its okay to cry
You stab stuff and it dies
This is an overall good game, nice game play, great visuals, interesting progression system. I like the lack of being spoon-fed objectives and quest markers. But.. it's just boring. Once you've played it for an hour, you've basically played the whole game. Everything else is just a derivation on that first bit. Doesn't really make you want to come back to it.
jogo.
BEST!!
10-10
all out great game dose take a bit off time to get in too 
baous
good story and awesome bosses
An incredible experience your first playthrough, probably the best if not one of the best first playthroughs I've ever had of a game. Make sure to savor and enjoy it because if you're like me, when you go back to experience it again it'll be all too familiar. This is the game I would erase from my memory to enjoy it for the first time again.   Like other souls-likes it'll be frustrating sometimes. Enemies hiding in corners and ceilings waiting to ambush you and take cheap shots, bosses that'll overwhelm and crush you until you die enough times to figure them out. But this game has an unparalleled feeling of exploration and discovery that I haven't experienced in other games that keep me willingly risking those ambushes.   If you want to play Co-op with a bud undisturbed and experience the whole game together, I'd recommend the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description] Seamless Co-op [/url] mod which you can find on Nexus Mods. It'll prevent invasions from other players during Co-op and allow you to play through all areas of the game that may otherwise prevent Co-op in the Vanilla game. Never was a fan of invasions so if you aren't either it is a good solution.
nuthin more to say
BEST GAME, BETTER THAN YOUR MOM'S COOKING
I want an OST.  Is it too much to ask for?
Great game as long as you don't kill Varre
margit op
best game
favorite souls game ever
couldnt find the ring
game good.
fun adventre game with chalenging bosses
Pros : level design and art direction  Cons : everything else : unbalanced difficulty that goes all over the place, ridiculous final boss, bosses being generally easier than fights against mobs...all the problems inherent to fromsoft games are back with a vengeance (ennemies that never fall off edges, that have infinite stamina and can combo you to death, that hit you through walls, that track you perfectly, etc etc etc).  A decent game that suffers from a lot of balance problems at best, and that feels cheap, lazy, unfair and hard for the sake of being hard at worst. The lock on system and camera are PREHISTORIC, just don't work properly, and are one of the reasons people think this game is "hard". It isn't, it's made artificially hard by dated mechanics that are dumbed down on purpose (eg input buffering, enemies reading your inputs, etc). With more modern mechanics we see in every game nowadays, elden ring would be trivially easy. Outdated game systems from 20 years ago are what makes the game hard.  All in all, it isn't as good as DS1, suffers from the same flaws, and just uses the best ideas fom it without ever managing to equal them. Eg ; I felt suterranean shunning ground was just a cheap and dilluted version of blighttown...most of the good ideas from ER are recycled from previous games.  A pretty good game, absolutely RUINED by a ridiculously unfair and cheap final boss and equally unfair and cheap mechanics that have plagued FS games since DS1.  5.5/10  EDIT : New game + is incredibly boring and pointless, appart from the sublime level design (all over again) and crushing everything with absurdly overpowered stuff. It's the easy mode. I don't get it.  Chances are you already got the best stuff from your first playthrough.  PLUS playing new game + makes all the "busted" mechanics feel even more cheap and obvious and will kinda "taint" your feelings on the whole game.   LET US SEE what the upcoming DLC brings to the table.
good
Mystery and Monsters,  like trying to remember a crazy dream before you fall asleep. 
Easily GOTY. I love the combat system where you can choose to play with different builds and style, the story that is hidden behind all differents quest of various NPCs. Above all, this masterpiece is completely orignal, which is absolutely unbelievable.
very good. radahn best girl
Bruh every prompt on screen basically alt-tabs me, leaving the mouse outside of the game. No game without mods
game too easy dont play if you want something challenging
Everything you could want out of a Souls-like and more. Elden Ring is one of those rare cases of a game that gets hyped to hell and back before release, and then actually DELIVERS on the hype. I already have about 100 hours on PS4, but I just couldn't not also get it on PC to play online.
This is the most addictive game ever... i cant stop playing
Good game.
good game but bad game
10/10 maidenless experience
I mean what can i say is just perfect
its neat
One of the better Dark Souls entries
Good way to spend alot of time 
add sex
GOAT GAME
very good very nice veery god veery niiiiice 
Epic
I want to bash my head in wall
I highly recommend this game! Easily the most approachable and dynamic soulsborne game! After completing the game's story over 5 times with different builds, I can say that no matter which path you choose to walk down with your character the game is both challenging and deeply satisfying!  The game's story and lore are easily my favourite from the soulsborne games. It's great place to start with souls-like games as the freedom you have in this game allows you to go away and explore if you reach a particularly tough area.  Very fun, highly personalised experience, easily one of the best games I've played!

Good with the multiplayer mod and friends.
THE best From Software game ever made. This game is the closest gaming has ever gotten to perfection. Absolutely a 10/10.
What.A.Game.
Masterpiece.
fun
so epic and kewl
after beating this game to completion (100% achievements) its safe to say that the asskicking you will get is worth it
yes
nice game
Gave me broken hand and broken controller. 60€ game + 50€ gear repairs. I love this game. This game is "No Pain No Gain Fr." You get lot's of maidens!
Elden Ring is a fantastic game for the right personality. If you are easily absorbed into your activities, then the first 50 hours of this game will feel like a dream. The next 50 hours will feel like your career is now being a Tarnished. After the following 50 hours, you will realize just how early you are in the game with 150 hours played. At this point, you have discarded the ideals of family, friends, obligations, and are pursuing all activities to make you into the true Elden Lord. Alas, the game has now become life, and you are a shell of your former self.   Its for these reasons that I cant enjoy this game, and that i can't stop enjoying playing this game no matter what occurs in life. Thus, I am hanging up the controler for good, and will get my dose of dopamine in other productive means.
GOATed
Amazing game. The open world is crazy and almost endless if u want to solo explore it. There are a lot of weapons, spells etc. so u can totaly play as u want.
Brave Tarnished… Thy strength befits a crown.
sexy game
Overall a great game, some lovey locations and stunning GFX in general for an open world game.  The combat feels clean simple to learn, difficult to master lots of flash backs to Zelda and Scrolls and other large open world exploration.   Class options have some interesting customisation options and combos that make messing around with builds compelling.  The story line was average and they could of used some more interesting names than everything starting with M or G, I cant remember names at the best of times so spent most of the game confused or lost who was who and why I should care.  The locations, puzzle dungeons and sometimes crazy ideas make for a very compelling game and the want to play again with a new build. The mount felt fun to use and the checking every hole and drop felt fun. However...  Negative: The bosses for the large part (not all but most) are just hot garbage, and are the one and only reason I wont consider a replay. Its been mentioned by better people before me, but the ability spam and almost zero time spent balancing them is clear, they feel like a sad after thought rather than a key part of the game and the ones that feel good are just average when compared to other games. Not to mention the awful camera issues on a large number of them. Its just a real shame that its so bad its putting a lot of people, like me, off playing NewGame+.
These are some of the words i gathered to describe this masterpiece: Beautiful, Challenging, Surprising, Frustrating, Rewarding!  It is a Must-play for this genre lovers.
best game
Very yes.
受苦受难的手残武士的一生
I bought ER 3 days after release for PS4. Played 700+ hours on PS4. After 12ish years (since 2008) I manged to buy a PC for myself. First game I bought ER. Only for the huge difference in visuals I will gladly sink 1000 hours into this game.  THANK YOU FROMSOFT FOR THIS INCREDIBLE GAME! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DLC!!!
It be good
10/10
You will die, it's part of your development through the game. Not finished and I love it. First "Souls" style game.
i suck at the game but 10/10
less clothing = more power
You guys have had almost a year to fix the stuttering on 12th and 13th Gen Intel Core CPUs and yet the game remains a stuttering mess. Do you know how much harder it is to kill Rennala when the damned game is stuttering as well? And THis is 1440p on an RTX 3080.. I mean come on!

Amazing game, and keeps getting better
This game was honestly amazing from start to finish. I recommend not doing a sorcery build first playthrough though because i was just absolutely goku style KAMEHAMEHAING everything and dominating it with Comet Azur and Rannis dark moon. I really loved the lore behind the bosses and i got a testosterone boost from Godfrey and i ordered a wallpaper off amazon and i've been working out 5 days a week thanks to him. Thank you fromsoftware and miyazaki. Godfrey cosplay incoming.
yes
FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD! FROM IS GOD!

Literally game of the year material with how vast the open world is to the diversity of random enemies around, plenty of dungeons to explore and items to collect, bosses are great and if you cant beat them just Git Gud:)
genial juego , esperando dlcs
Despite the feeling that this game was trolling me hard all the way through I enjoyed it. I'd like to see the following improvements for their next game. 1. Fix erratic camera angle 2. Better target lock (why am I locked on an enemy at the back of several?) 3, Stop mobs hitting through wall (I'm looking at you Godskin Noble) 4. More robust coop mode 5. Easier to navigate inventory Otherwise, keep up the good work FromSoftware!
It's pretty good   This game doesn't suck you suck.
I got 100%, yet still no maidens. Why must this happen to me?
I love this game.
It´s good but after 350 hours it´s not fun anymore.
I honestly find the controls to be rather janky, the camera is clunky, the graphics are surprisingly disappointing. It sort of just feels dull somehow, I don't know. Just my unbiased opinion going into the game knowing nothing other than it is well liked.
Rule me Rani
hjkhj
thank you :)
I have genuinely never loved a game more than this. I was pissed it won GOTY before I played it, and now I think that it shoud've won greatest game of all time.
A must play game, this game on all levels is perfect. replay ability,graphics,controls,etc all great one of my favorites in the souls franchise
too hard, gonna pull the come back in 6 months when im bored strat
Brilliant.  Although it's a little too demanding for a game that barely looks any better than dark souls 3 graphically. Shouldn't have to require a 3080ti to run this at above 60fps at 4k.
First play-through after Dark Souls III : *Runs around for hours without realizing I can Press (A) for jump*
It's fun
still no maidens

Elden Ring is a game that requires a lot of time investment. It's a celebration of FromSoftware's previous works, but it is certainly not their best one. The couple of bosses in the late game have long combo strings or absurd movement that often leaves the player with little time to counter attack, turning the endgame into a slog for a lot of players. There are tools to mitigate this, such as the multiplayer and spirit ashes, but also cheapens the victory for some players. The build variety is the greatest strength of the game, but the open world nature and inconsistent quality of the bosses discourages many to replay this title.
VERY LIT
Difficult but fun if you like dark souls I would recommend you get this game. 8/10
My favorite ass beating.
easy
Great Game, love how hard it is and the fact that it can continue to get harder every time you beat it. Would recommend
my favourite 2022 videogame
4 armpits Ranni-chan
I killed a Dragon while on my Horse. Only 3 hours in and i'm glad!
Great open world. Wonderful addition to the fromsoft category.
It's an incredible game with awsome gameplay.
Elden Ring is an incredible adventure, there's just so much to explore!   I appreciate how the map was done, visible landmarks so you know where to go but not what you would find.
dark souls 4
most awaited and well recommended game for both new and veteran souls fan even, players who are new to the souls genre can enjoy in the lands between 
hello chat i finally beat margit i have 4 hours in the game, says 22 for god knows what reason, prolly went afk while running it at my friend's but anyway this is a good game, i love the graphics, animations, and gameplay. you have to morph your playstyle sometimes, and for margit i realized i had to pump out as much damage as possible so i went for a lighter attack build, let em attack the cooperator and absolutely destroyed him from behind. it's insane how fun and rewarding the game is, especially with the challenge. please get the fuckin game man
Surprise surprise, it's very good. This is the only From Soft game that I've played and actually enjoyed, though I haven't tried Bloodborne yet.
fun
Too hard
it's kicking my butt alright but crap i love this frickin game. I'd give it a 7/8 tbsp out of a stick of butter
Love playing co-op. Would definitely recommend to others.
Without a doubt one of the most difficult games I've ever played, but also one of the most rewarding, the world, the art, the bosses, everything is absolutely superb in this game.  Just be aware, you will die a LOT (I've already died at least around 50+ times) from dragons, from wolves, even a small seemingly harmless dragonfly... But press forward, don't give up, this is a challenge definitely worth playing through.  Also, fix the muthafucking microstutters.  9.5/10
Most beautiful game ever!
mhm
One if not the best rpg of all time. Difficulty brutal. Story interesting. Characters amazing. 10/10 would die to fight again.
Fun.
This game will make you angry, often. When I first got this game on PS4 Pro, I would constantly have to deal with fits of rage, as this game will put the hurt on you constantly, and without mercy.  So I bought it again for PC.
The first boss took way too long
is this one of the coolest games ever? definitly. will I replay it? HELL NO!
I got to marry snowy waifu doll. Definitely game of the year.
The look and gamplay is fun not at all dissapointed
This is the game I have the most hours own, and dwarfs any other game I own if you look at how quickly I clocked those hours. Probably spent ~150 hours 100%-ing the game, and then the remaining 100 helping randos kill bosses, just because of how enjoyable the combat is. This was my first Souls-like game, and it set me on a path to discovering that these are the kind of games I really like, and I will be ever grateful to it for leading me to Sekrio.  That said, Duo bosses and oversized enemies (the camera is the real enemy in these fights) provide some of the worst boss fights in the series, and are poorly designed choices in an otherwise great game.
Fun on your own, but a bit confusing to know what you are doing.  Way more fun when you have someone to play with.
i want to die 
Might be the best game ever made. seriously
I really suck at this game. But I still managed to beat Melania solo on NG+ 2. Great learning curve.
its fun
fight boss then die instantly 50 times!!!!!!!!!!
I would fuck the Elden beast
not bad
Game sucks
good
its a game
Death becomes your best friend, 10/10
Amazing game, great combat, lots of replay-ability. And 2022 Game of the Year.
I already lost my mind.
coop could use updates the coop was the main thing i was looking forward to, so when I found it was possible I quickly bought 2 copies for me and a friend . excitement turned to very disappointing coop experience , the fact that ~ - you cant access the light checkpoints - have to summon your companion all over again if one of you dies - progress you make as a "finger " won't save for you , only for the summoner. - not being able to block invaders is annoying , just want to enjoy the game itself without anyone 3xs better w/ better equip sabotaging you. I really believe this game could be a better coop experience for those of us , wanting a challenging souls-like game to enjoy with a friend. I hope they give this mechanic the love it deserves.
the gus are worth the pain
Perfection
[h1]Game Of The Year - 2022, says it all[/h1]  It is beautiful, story-rich and challenging. I've spent countless hours exploring the Lands Between, learning the lore, finding rare loot and felling enemies. The game is difficult, which makes it even more worth playing it. [b]10/10[/b]
usu
best game ever
cause it gud
-
What I learned after 50 hrs  - Melina is hot  - fuck you margit why did I kill you three times  - ISTG IF I HEAR "We wIlL DevOUr tHE gOds toGEtHeR" with this musty crust rusty voice i will hurt some one  - D<ont kill Vare(the guy that calls you maidenless you will suffer later  - Melina>>>Rani  - this is fkg depressing  - Scenary go brrrrr
good
Rump Ahead!
good game   
Really fun game. I think its easier than darksouls and a lot or stuff to do
This is one of the video games of all time. There is no doubt about that. Still, this is not a perfect 10/10 game for me and I will try to explain what I like and dislike about this game. This review is mostly spoiler free. This is my first Fromsoft game and some of the points may apply to all Fromsoft games I only played the first hour of DS3 so I don't know much about other FS titles.  Things that I like:  There is an insane amount of content to do. The exploration in early game feels really good and rewarding. You will meet/find something interesting and useful everywhere you go. There are 300+ weapons,60+ summons 150+ spells, 500+ armor pieces for you to find and make your build. The game feels like a true open world, just go and do whatever you like. You can add awesome skills to your weapon. You can change your weapons' scaling if it's a normal weapon. If you're running a dexterity build and want to wield that Berserk greatsword? You only need the base strength requirement then you can make the sword  scale from dexterity by chaning it's affinity. You can wield very large weapons with one hand most other games will not let you do this. The game is somewhat difficult but you can complete everything, even if you are bad at the game, by using the tools game give you. Playing multiplayer is rewarded with a useful item which is difficult to farm in singleplayer. This is not an entirely sword & roll game, you can make all kinds of bombs, potions, throwing knifes, apply coating to your weapons to inflict elemental damage etc. The game has funny things in it like a big jar dude and funny armors Level and World design is astonishing. Environmental storytelling is very strong. You can tell a lot about what happened in an area just by looking. You can play this game as hack&slash game or survival horror game all depends on your build.  [spoiler] bro becomes a meteor [/spoiler]  Things that I dislike:  Repeating bosses. Some bosses will appear 10+ times. I know it is very difficult to fill a map this big with unique bosses but if you care about it you should know this before. They could have made the world smaller and nobody would complain. Dungeons all feel samey, same enemies with same layoutat the end there will be a the same boss room. The quest system is bad. If you're playing this blind without looking stuff online, chances are, you are going to miss a good portion of the game. NPC quests are literally you talk to a guy then he teleports to  a random location and you talk to him again and repeat.  To unlock 2 entire endgame areas you need 2 items, one drops from a boss and the other one is at a totally random location where you have to hit a random pot to get it. In the endgame exploration is meh, you do some platforming & fighting and find an item, "upgrade material 6" but you can buy the same thing infinitely for a small price at that point. Game performance is bad, the game runs on less frames than some other open world rpg with similar graphics. After you made it into endgame the difficulty spikes up considerably. Not only the bosses but normal mobs will 1-2 shot you unless you have very high health and heavy armor then maybe 2-4 hits. There are normal enemies that  are harder to kill than most of the bosses. The difficulty is unbalanced. There is a boss type of enemy guarding the main boss arena door. He is harder to defeat than the real boss inside. He is on horseback but you can't use your horse, no summons, nowhere to hide from his ranged attacks. He also has more health & hits harder and you can't land a crit attack on him. Certain enemies will punish you for healing, the moment you drink your health potion they will launch a long range attack to interrupt you. People call it input reading and I think it is pure BS. Some fights have a rythm and flow, you can dodge attacks intutively. Some other fights have delayed attacks to trick you. The dude holds his sword up in the air for 5 seconds and you wait for it. I don't think this is fun and does not fit into the context of "melee fighting". A few enemies spawn fires on ground, when you touch it the fire will kill you instantly. This doesn't make sense when you touch fire it sets you on fire then you take damage slowly. You fight very large enemies to die attacks you can't even see since you're just attacking his foot and tickling down his health. Good and interesting characters with very little screentime. Enemies and regions have static level. You are over or under leveled most of the time. You will discover a castle to insta kill the boss inside since you leveled up too much Coop mode is limited, the game limits you in an area with the goal of beating the area boss. You will be sent back to your world after defeating the area boss. There are very useful craftable items which require collectibles that are limited in the world or very tedious to grind. Some aspects of the game are similar to MMORPGs where you farm item b so you can farm item a. Input Buffering, if you press roll 2 times quickly you will roll again after done rolling. This input system is almost never useful it is only there to punish you for spamming buttons. Story is average, there are interesting side quests and lore elements but the main story of the game is you wake up and kill everything. If you look at it there is no story in the game, only a very small number of events happen in your playthrough. A normal playthorugh is literally "go kill the main boss", "ok i made it to the main boss but the door is locked", "go kill 10 other bosses to unlock the door", "kill the main boss". The game is not story driven but lore driven. One of the questline and ending is confirmed to be mistranslated (the ending turns out to have a complete opposite meaning) from the original Japanese script in to English. This raise the question; how much of this game is translated accurately? Second phase of the final boss is the worst type of video game boss. That one boss hits you once and runs 10km away and you chase him the entire figth kind of boss. Many people say the figth was designed with your horse in mind but they forgot to enable it. The game has a system where if a merchant NPC dies you will obtain their shop item and their shop will be available in the hub world. At first this seems like the devs don't want you to miss anything in the game but this is a total scam. You can still miss items.
kinda reminds me of dark souls
It's pretty good
Why are you reading reviews, it was game of the year, just get it already.
one of the best games out there
if you are anything like me and never played a souls game but you liked diablo games,poe,fable, just all around a game with alot of possibilities with loot customizing my weapons and armor to make the character what i like but searching and playing a bunch of games that are ok but just dont do it for you this game caught me off guard i never thought i would like it never play dark souls games but let me tell you the fantastic characters , the fact that the story litterally feels real bc theres no quest system you have to figure it out, the feeling of accomplishment when you finally smack down the boss you got your butt kicked by. the open world is so detailed never once did i ever feel like there was any filler content or filler quest to take time. truly a masterpiece i will probrobly play again when im old lol its not as hard as some make it out to be if you struggle youtube builds i use Nizar GG on youtube his builds are described perfect and great lore behind them. i only had to have help with 2 bosses and one was last boss the elden b , so in short its top 3 games ive ever played and i litterally check for dlcs every day wishing bc for the first 100 hours it was like a drug the visuals are great the combat is so fluid no janky feeling like some games gah im sorry i have a crush on this game i was looking for something to scratch the itch i had for a game that captured me like diablo 2 did back in the day and this game did that and then some so yes buy it buy it at 2x full price and you are still getting a deal thanks developers for delivering this game that lived up to the hype! (sorry my grammer and punctuation is non existent)
good
very good
Deserves GOTY
this game is really cool and i think that you should buy it bc like its good and stuff (frick you margit i hate you)
This is the first review I've ever written, so go easy on me. But as a new Souls player myself I wanted to write about my experience for others looking into the games of the genre for the first time.  [h1] Overview [/h1]  This game is truly phenomenal, and breathtaking at times. Having tried FromSoft games in the past and rage quitting at the first boss because I couldn't get past it, I was a little skeptical of purchasing this game. However the world looked beautiful and I decided to give it a try.   Immediately I was sucked into The Lands Between and its beauty. The world is massive and if you think you can go somewhere you probably can. Combat takes a bit to get used to, but doesn't take too long to become proficient, but can take hours to master. The lore is so deep it is always rewarding when you find a new snippet and can piece together a little bit more about the history of The Lands Between. Questing can be quite difficult at times trying to figure out where to go and what to find, but is very rewarding when you make it to the next step. This game is not for everyone, but it has a lot to offer.  [h1] World [/h1]  Once I opened the door and saw Limgrave for the first time I was taken back at how beautiful it was. After taking in the Erdtree and Stormveil off in the distance I took off into The Lands Between to see where I could go. I was not expecting it to be as open as it was. If you think you can get somewhere, chances probably are that you can get there.   On my quest to acquire all legendary item in the game on my second play-through I explored every nook and cranny in the Lands Between. It blew me away all the places I missed, or thought were unreachable. It also took me to some of the most beautiful places and also some of the hardest, but it pays off greatly to explore.  [h1] Gameplay/Combat [/h1]  Elden Ring is a lot more forgiving than other Souls Borne games due to its open world design. However, it can still pose quite a challenge if you want it to. I say this because Elden Ring is a true open world where as other FromSoft titles are more linear and require some bosses to be beaten to access the next area. There are some areas blocked by bosses in Elden Ring, however, a lot of the word can be accessed without having to engage in these fights. If you get to a boss you cannot beat you can go back into the world to find a better weapon or level up some more to get more prepared. Whereas in other Souls titles you'd just have to "git gud". But if you want a more "true" souls experience you do have the option to go straight to bosses and fight until you git gud.   While I haven't tried all weapon types and styles of combat yet, the combat feels very good. While its a little tedious to learn for new players it does not take too long to be able to at least have a chance against enemies, and theres plenty of areas with smaller bosses to get good and practiced up before going up against main bosses. There are also many different types of weapons that cater to different combat styles so there is something for everyone. Some weapons like colossal weapons are for more experienced players but there are very viable options for people new to this style of game and still make it an enjoyable experience given its difficulty at times.  [h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]  Elden Ring is a beautiful game with a vast open world that highly encourages and rewards exploration. The combat feels very good and offers things to both new and veteran players. The lore is very deep and there is a ton of it if you want to look for it. Which I do highly recommend as makes a fascinating story. If you are wanting to get into Souls Borne games this is a great intro into their genre. After playing through this game several times I now want to go back and accomplish what I never could before and play through the other FromSoft games.
best game ive ever played
controls are too wonky on mkb to justify purchasing this game. if they want people to spend 60$ on their title, perhaps they should spend the 20 min required to actually list the mkb buttons...
great game
GOATED
I myself have never played a Dark souls game like this before, and I am really enjoying this game play. Though it is very difficult at times, there are paths and ways to go around said difficult routes.  This game will make you feel like you are near the end or at least put some time into it, but in reality you are no where near the end. Such a massive game!
margaret thatcher
Great open-world rpg, quirky user interface, worth every penny.
I loves this game.
With 420 hours played and all achievements earned, I feel like I have the experience to speak on whether this is a good game or not.  IT IS AMAZING!!!  Take your time.  Explore.  Look at the beautiful scenery.  Tweak your ashes, skills, spells, incantations, and gear.  Some bosses can be tough but that's ok.  When you kill them, you feel like you actually achieved something.
Best game eva made
its simply the best game ever made
fun, hard, disheartening, rewarding, repeat
Great game.
Addictive and Beautiful. 9/10
fun
One of my favorite games of all time - worth every penny.
Love the gameplay. Honestly not a huge fan of the story or how it is told, but the combat mechanics, audio and the insane variation of weapons, magic and skills that you can use is incredible. Highly recommend.
i like old necklace
good
Yeah, Good game m8. Ultra rank in arena and still not good enough
Melina = babe  
Game good but hard :( :( :( :( :(
It has been a long time since I've played a game that as given me so much immeasurable excitement and wonder. Thank you FromSoftware for having a dream and the artistic and hard work to actually accomplish it. Other games might be dull now, but it will always be worth it.
Pinkletoj
Simply Amazing! Stupid Tough!
had no hoes hour  in had a hoe 10/10 
amazing game. cant wait for the DLC and more bosses
smeldin bling >:3
bread and the cheese
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   elden bling
So good. It's a must play for Dark Souls fans.
Pretty good
great game 
The game can be very difficult but it is possible to make it more enjoyable (still difficult though) with certain items, which is great for people like me who kinda suck.
Good game I guess. Here's a good fried chicken recipe:  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours. When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. 
My lord, is this game something that gets me going.  I have had games like this, but this one stands out. You know those games that just make you look for every little detail, looking stuff up to find out more and whatnot, yes, this is that.  I remember my first time playing it through - Looking at the map trying to find something that stands out, whether buildings or rubble, going there and finding something new. This feeling is amazing.  Questing, still sucks as it does in Dark Souls, you could get lucky and blindly follow or they actually tell you to go somewhere, but most of the time, good luck. Wish they could've added a little notebook which writes out clues that as if you the character is writing them down, so you can piece the hints together to know what to do next.  Gameplay is good ol' Dark Souls, run your head into bosses, beat them, get dopamine, only now most of the time you can sidetrack and get leveled if you get stuck at a boss, which can be a bad for hardcore souls-like connoisseurs, for me, I liked it, gave me a reason to side track and find new shit.  PVP - eh never been into it, and as I know, pretty dead.  Music is as expected from fromsoft, some of the best, when you launch the game and the tune plays. One word. SHIVERS.  This is the only game I've ever spent full price for and I don't regret it.
Beautiful, and jaw dropping
Some bosses are super frustrating but overall, great game.
its aight
Elden Ring is a must-play for any action RPG fan. The world is vast and filled with unique environments and creatures to explore. The story is captivating and keeps you hooked from start to finish. The combat is smooth and satisfying, with a deep character progression system that allows you to create a playstyle that's truly your own. Overall, Elden Ring is a remarkable game that should not be missed.
Great game with SeamlessCoop mod.  Worst part for me: quest tracking was not developed at all.
This is honestly the worst Soulsborne game. The biggest problem is the bosses. If you play without spirits, you often have to dodge the boss for 20-30 seconds before you finally get an opportunity to get a hit in and go back to dodging for 30 seconds. The bosses lack a serious back and forth aspect, and that makes the fights very unsatisfying. This is without mentioning that bosses will randomly add attacks to the end of combo strings that seem "safe." Thus, the fight basically requires rote memorization through trial and error to understand which boss attacks are truly "safe" to respond to with an attack.   If you play with spirits, the bosses become extremely easy and you essentially just abuse the enemy ai flaws. For a series known for its bosses, this game has very few fun boss fights.  The next biggest problem is the open world. While the world is somewhat fun to explore in your first playthrough, the loot often feels spread way too thin compared to past games because unlike past soulsborne games, Elden Ring is an open world game. You often find crap that is irrelevant to your build waiting to find something that may finally get you to change weapons/armor/spells. And in the end, the open world. makes replays a complete slog. The best parts of the game end up being the legacy dungeons that aren't used enough. Overall, From Soft finally lost the ball on this one. I would not recommend the game over any other soulsborne game.
FromSoftware is consistent af looking forward to playing Dark Souls Remaster, haven't yet!! Would be dope to see Bloodborne for PC someday. I wish we didn't see item nerfs cuz some people beat a totally different game earlier on imo I own elden ring for ps4 and for pc
It's like dark souls kinda
10+
I love it so much I just want to rip me little head off.
good

More spells than hogwarts legacy
Try fingers, But be wary of good game.
A huge fan of all previous souls games and blood borne i was always interested to see how they could take the franchise further and oh man have they taken a huge leap in the right direction, the open world and freedom this game offers is rivalled by none, with all the beauty of the difficulty of previous ones in the title don't even wait for this game to go on sale buy it now full price i promise you get your monies worth.
I love this masterpiece of a game! The lack of guidance is just so immersive, it really makes you dive deep into this game. I just can't describe how amazing this game is for real!
Gigachads own this game. What Hogwash Legacy wishes it was.
good game
It's getting me out of my depression by making me angry instead. 10/10
Soooo close to being descent. They graphics are pretty good. Large layout with lots to discover BUT the controls and motion of the prayers are probably to worst I have seen in a game. You have forced unnatural movements that allow for bad play and fighting. I even tried every character in the game to see if one was descent to play with.  10/10 regret this expensive purchase.
People are far too easily impressed these days. I recommend it but don't go expecting some sort of life changing experience like most people pretend it is. The game is mid, Especially compared to Sekiro, Bloodborne and Nioh.  The "open world" format just doesn't suit the series. Weak, boring and repeated bosses. Weakest lore yet. An incredibly forgettable soundtrack. I can only remember maybe one track from the entire game, a far cry from other games. A large build variety but only a few builds are actually viable, especially if you're a online player. Dragon AI is laughably bad. Malenia never killed me but the shitty "platforming" trying to get one of the game's ending sure did.  But the game has it's moments and like I said, I do recommend it. Just understand that it's not perfect. Like everything else, Get it on a sale.
Dark Souls cooler Brother
good game
Beautiful game. Must play game for anyone who likes single player open-world games. You can make the game as easy or as hard as you want with the right buffs and gear so don't let the difficulty of the game discourage you

Great game I loved the story and would really like to see more games like this come out.( Open World Boss Fights)
Forgot so many times what time is when playing this game. Both due to the gorgeous open world and kicked my face kicked in by bosses (especially the crucible knightt duo). I can't really put a review into words here cuz then i'd probably write an essay. Go buy it and explore for yourself what I mean, Tarnished.  Oh and one thing for all of you who have played it already:  "I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella."
best game ive played
Game of the year and deservedly so.
the game hard very hard harder hardest (exclamation mark)
it so harddddddddddddd i love it

its ok, kind of over-hyped though
This made my balls shrivel up into raisins.
this game is majestic

their is so much stuff to do and i have barley scratched it 10/10
This game was designed by sadists.

I've never loved and hated a game at the same time so much in my entire life. Phenomenal boss fights, outstanding open world, beautiful item design, worthy of GOTY in every sense. Fantastic game.
Death. Just DEATH!
It's a lot of fun and I enjoy the challenge. I like to play with my friends though and this is an excruciatingly difficult game to play with friends. It's very random where multiplayer is enabled and the map is supposed to have blue rings to show where you can, but they don't always work. Very frustrating.
The greatest game of all time no debate!
This game is fucking trash the Malenia is so bad i want to do thing to my slef because of her
amazing
Perfect everything’s perfect
try finger but whole
Big tree = good
After 100 hr of playtime I fast travelled to a grace in Limgrave and my game crashes every single time I try to play. No matter what I do. Optimized ig. Lost 100hr character. Think this is the end of my souls game career.  Edit: Just verify game files.
Love it
shit game tbh
sekiro 2 when?? 
RIP sleep :')
I'd say Elden is alright
want build variety? play console. there are only moonveil and rivers of blood users here.
Amazing.
Elden Ring Really Epic  Try fingers Butt hole
Very challenging but very deep and rich gameplay combined with outstanding graphics and truly incredible art and sound design. Even if you are not a fan of the SOULS franchise or Bloodborn, you should still give this a try if you enjoy: action rpgs, tough but fair gameplay, crazy boss fights and completely customizalbe character building.
If you haven't played this game, what the hell are you waiting for?
W game
the game ever however does lack adachi, which would make it perfection
good game
pog
its alright
As a individual that really could never find my footing in the dark souls genre, outside of games like Hollow Knight, i Realllly liked this game. It certainly has a lot of the same frustrations you get from Dark Souls, but at least i feel like it's so much more flexibility to play at your pace and overcome these challenges in all sorts of different manners. I highly recommend especially to those that are on the fence because they never got that good experience from the Dark Souls franchise.  easily a 10/10
One of the best games I recently played. Even though a few areas got annoying after a while I very much enjoyed exploring and sometimes just looking at some parts of the world.  There is so much side content that you may not even find. If you want to find things, this time you actually have to look at messages and item descriptions. I myself really enjoyed that. Some say that the reused assets and similar looking caves and dungeons ruin them, but because these areas are completely optional, I am surprised they put even this much effort into those alongside all the other optional and well-hidden areas.  Overall the game is amazing, but this does not mean I would recommend it to everyone. You have to have the affinity to throw yourself at the next thing blocking your way again and again or to try new things until you find a setup that works for the current problem. Reallocating stats in this game can be done fairly early on and quite a few times per journey which is a very welcome thing.
good
cheese, smile for the camera.
great game
very good
hard, but yo can make the game very easy
be wary of pain therfore, use dog

fuckiong great game 10 out of 10!
if this review is stashed away down below the depths because this is a review over a year after this game released then idc bcs this game is insane, worth the money because there is so much to do. maybe i've never played a real open world game but i feel like this game never ends and im not even halfway done with the story. at first i didnt want to buy this game because i dont usually spend 60$ on games anymore but this game is worth it 10x over. like i said i am nowhere near finishing this game but if you somehow find this review and are conflicted on buying this game over a year later then if you can please buy and play this game. i havent gone to depth on the music, sounds, gameplay, areas, enemies, bosses and many more but it is all amazing, they all blend with each other in an amazing way so far. ive never played a souls game before but im glad this was my first and if i change my mind or want to add more to this review i will during my playthrough. 
l love this!!!!
I bought this game when it first came out and it was awesome. I took quite a long break from it, and also upgraded my computer quite a bit...but now that I've redownloaded the game and started playing again, my FPS has dropped significantly and I'm experiencing stuttering that I didn't have before. My computer has only gotten much faster than the last build, so there's no reason for this other than updates that have occurred in the interim. Can't recommend a game that you can't play without frame chugs on an i5-13600k and an RTX 3070 ti, both overclocked (conservatively and cooled appropriately). SSD's, 32Gb RAM.....there's no reason for this.
gg
Elden ring era tudo que eu sentia falta em um jogo mundo aberto, toda a construção do jogo é tão boa, entrou no meu top10 fácil, a exploração desse jogo é IMPECÁVEL e o sentimento que o jogo te traz do jogador fazer sua própria jornada é muito boa, esse jogo PRA MIM beira algo perto do perfeito, o jogo é bonitasso, recomendar esse jogo é algo muito variável pessoalmente ele é ótimo mas todo o design do jogo inteiro é tão contra corrente do que é acostumado nos jogos que pra alguns podem ser ruim ou bom.  Alguns dos pontos negativos da minha experiência não foram muitos mas estavam ali mesmo assim, desempenho do jogo não é muito bom é pesado e não bem polido considerando os gráficos do jogo, alguns design de boss deixaram um pouco a desejar e repetitivos
this game......is truly crack
its like if someone made a game that was good
das gut.
It's ok
so good
It good
DOG
cool 
I am lamentably bad at this game  Edit: i killed a few bosses, i like it now
   good game

I AM LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beat the game in sub 40 hour time. Imma speedrun it next. I hate the stuttering and bugs this game has. But overall nonudemod/10
good
Dont play it doesnt have guns
good
The ring was quite old
Elden Ring introduced my wife to gaming.  She was watching me play the game some and really enjoyed how it looked, and asked innocently to try playing, even though she had never played anything but mobile games before.  Months later, she 100%ed the game before I did, completed the game 3 times to get all the endings and everything, and now she's asking me to play Dark Souls 1 and several other games I enjoy.  Thanks FromSoft, you've corrupted my wife, 11/10 would buy again.
if yall like souls stile combat and a good story i recommend it, if you are like me and find souls combat hard and weird then dont buy it
Positives about the game - It has everything you would want in a game - waifus, pope dog, awesome gameplay, beautiful graphics. Negatives - it has no widescreen support. But in the end would recommend - 10/10.
I don't just throw out the phrase "Saved Gaming" to describe just any game, and this masterpiece is easily the one of the best in history. 10/10
My first ever souls game and it was awesome,the graphics were awesome the fighting was good, and overall i would recomend it
it get crashed a looooot
fromsoft delivering the highest quality gameplay experience as usual
Very fun.
praise the game!
One of my best gaming purchases..
fort, night
no maidens?
love it
yes
Mohged all over my walls
Very hard game, but thats the best part about it.
It's that Ratatouille movie scene.  Nothing will beat the wonder and awe I felt playing this game at launch for the first time. Discovery, challenge, adventure, all the while learning from other Tarnished that there was yet more to explore? You could not get me to put it down. Elden Ring single-handedly reignited my love for the RPG genre, and gaming as a whole at the time, sparking my nostalgia for great games of old and burning into me a desire for more. Even as I died, and died again, and again and again.  Even a year later, there's rarely a week gone by that I'm not playing this game. After being my first, other Fromsoft games I previously avoided due to their difficulty, I now leap at the chance to challenge. This is Miyazaki and the team's Magnum Opus. So far, anyway.
i forgot since i havent played in a while :)
sticks and stones may break my bones, but i sure have broken my table playing this game
its a cool game
I'd rather clean my toilet
Lovely
i hate this game with everything i have i beat it around 4 times and lost my mind multiple times during it i had mental breakdowns i had panic attacks even my girlfriend started getting scared of me it ruined my mental health
very good
The epitome of what a fantasy open world game should be.
buy it now.

Really hard but really fun game. If you are having trouble progressing and feel overwhelmed at the beginning, just go online to the elden ring wiki or watch some youtube tutorials.
100/10 best game of all time hands down. DLC when?
69
It's deserve GOTY but it's kinda more overrated  ใครแม่งDesign Radagon วะขอชกหน้าแม่งสักที  ส่วน Malenia Gameplayสนุกดีจุ้ปๆ 😘
Every hour playing this game has a moment like this. Seems like a game that's been in development for 20 years. What they have accomplished with scale is unimaginable. Crazy to think that AAA studios don't even come close to 1 % of what Elden Ring is.
hard but amazing game 
prepare to die
Good game
5 out 5 stars. The game is amazing. From the experience to the part where youre forced to git gud.
have played 69 hours and i wish i could replay those hours over and over again
masterpiece
Got into game, died, got resurrected, get out of cave, get called maidenless, die to tree sentinel 200 times and quit 
i hate this game
send this game to someone who likes big black hairy women
Amazing. Game Surprises you constantly. There is a ton of content that is easily missed so there is high replay value.
An amazing game with tons of new discovery with every new playthrough of the game ! DLC WHEN?
good
good
Great game but still there are some issues id like to address. Already i don't have many hours on the game but the matchmaking is a total pain, i got put up against someone with more heals than i have myself, that just isn't fair, The invaders needs to be nerfed, sorta like how they do it in dark souls. Because i just fought the hardest battle I've fought yet, and it was not because i played bad mind you, i got them low everytime, but just the sheer amount of heals made it impossible to kill them. Great game yet the multiplayer and summons need to be fixed
Finally manage to defeat a boss after X attempts.  Me: Let me share my experience with others and give them a helpful tip on how to defeat the boss. Also me:"Didn't expect weak foe"
Time goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
amazing!!!!1
I want to nominate this award to my reformed orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton

you get to fight things

When i started playing Elden Ring, i had no girls. now however, I'm Maidenless
Prepare your anus
Nice!
I finally beat the game in under 100 hours. This game is my first souls type game and I never have been more in love with it. No game has made me have the ups and downs this game has. I would be angry for hours on a single boss and then as soon as you defeat a boss a RUSH of happiness and accomplishment comes over you. I would like to thank my boys for getting me into this game. And thank you From Software for making a great and challenging game. I have grown into a better gamer and a better person all around. This game has officially taught me how to be relentless and never give up, there is always a way to conquer your enemy.
Game is terrible you can't even kill the first boss it's literally scripted to prevent you from doing so 0/10
Peak
top 3 gaming experience
Help me
Best game ever simply put!
cool game, the cheese tastes grate too.
Exploration is amazing and early game set pieces are unreal, You'll have fun until the game says you aren't allowed to anymore. Late game is for meta gaming and cheeses. I got bored fighting the final bosses because they all have an insta-kill move. It's not challenging, it just kills you.
Best.
Muy bueno
 Spawn, roll, roll, roll, spam attack, roll. Boss holds attack above your head striking a jojo pose, you roll. He slams. 9000 damage. Your asshole prolapses. Gravity is changing. It starts bending reality.  A black hole is formed. Space-time breaks. You and the boss both get sucked into your dark chasm anus. A black void greets you.   YOU DIED
Praise Ranni.  This message was brought to you by Shadow Wizard Money Game.
If you have some patience and love mysterious games this is it! Elden Ring is a Master Piece and totally worth every dollar!
the game is very longer compair to other souls game
Elden Ring is one of, if not the most overrated and overhyped games I have ever played. This isn't a "skill issue" and I don't need to "get good". Pinning blame on the players is a way that I've seen Elden Ring fanboys obfuscate from actual problems the game has. Compared to nearly every other From Software game except maybe Demons Souls or Dark Souls 2, Elden Ring is outshone in nearly every conceivable way. The combat is just unsatisfying, the npcs are some of the worst in the series, and the open world aspect just does not work in the context of a souls-like game. The visual design in this game in general, except for maybe a few specific examples, is just unappealing in a way that makes areas not as interesting as previous games. Elden Ring has inconsistent design philosophies which makes the game feel unnecessarily frustrating at times. The game is filled with gank fights and unnecessary annoyances. A distant ledge that looks to be part of a wall could lead to a secret or may be blocked by an invisible wall that causes you to fall to your death. The game feels like it was made by people who had no communication with each other. The game also suffers from copy and paste, cookie cutter, pre-fabbed dungeons which comprise of nearly all of the games side content. In these dungeons you may find an interesting boss, but it most certainly also appears in at least 3 other dungeons and the reward will likely be not worth the effort you put into the dungeon. All of this could be excused, and I could accept this game as just being a subpar slip into From's library, if not for the atrocious optimization that still hasn't been fixed over a year after release. It is honestly some of the worst I have seen coming from a triple A studio in recent years. If anyone tells you that Elden Ring is their favorite soulsbourne game, either they haven't played many soulsbourne games, or they've seen something in the game that I just haven't. If you are looking to see if this game is worth buying or not, save yourself $20 and buy Dark Souls Remastered instead.
Very super good
mid ring
this game makes me hate short people and dogs, wilful traitors all
good shit
great game woo hoo 
great game....played it on the ps5 and xbox as well....love it
Beautiful. Eerie. Haunting. Frustrating. But compelling. Not the story, as much as there even is any story. But visually and atmospherically, it's compelling. It's oddball in a way that's outlandish but rarely gruesome and not at all cartoonish. It's a world where themes and qualities that don't generally belong together join up and harmonize in a way that strangely seems almost natural. Like with Alice in Wonderland and some Annie Lennox songs. That gets to be soothing, somehow.
Played it more on PS5, but this is my favorite souls game for sure.

fun but challenging game
Sacrificed myself for madam waifu only for her to hunt me down
I've played this game for 70 hours and haven't even fought the Elden Ring yet.
its fun,when you let it be a game
This game is so good that i wish i could play again without remember anything in this game.
Masterpiece of a game but they kinda screwed up invasions IMO and strayed away from good invasion mechanics like in DS2, it could have been repurposed but not like it is now where coop isn't taken advantage of with such an open world and restricts you to certain areas, but leave it up to the modders I guess to do the dirty work
good
Seek Therapy,Behold Therapist!
it's pretty dope.
GG
Best game i ever played
yes
do you like getting spooked? do you like having nightmares you never thought you could have? have you ever stared death in its amber, madness-filled eyes? you will. elden ring is an expansive yet gorgeous open world with all the charm of the six flags that got abandoned after hurricane katrina, but with the weather patterns of hurricane katrina. you'll be terrible at it until you're marginally less terrible at it. you'll sigh in relief and then a remnant will crawl out of the floor of your apartment while you try to panic heal or panic water your plants. so have fun with that.
Dying simulator game
very fun
love this game no complaints
pop
best soul games
It's fun.
Beautiful game... 10/10
After 300+ hours on this game and 100% completion i can fairly say i'm still maidenless
game gud
Worth $100
broke a controller fighting malenia

Real review for once. This review comes from a person that didn't really care too much about any other dark souls game. Let me just state, I absolutely love this game, it gave me so much freedom that other open world games would've never given you. I loved weapon combos and dressing up and stuff in this game. Pvp was fun but pve for me is just the best. I loved going through the game and finding all the mysteries. I've completed the game on my ps4 at about 200 to 250 hours and i've done everything I can find to do. I'm currently playing through with my friend and I'm planning on doing mods.   The only things I didn't like about the game, were the dungeons and rebirths. I loved changing my build mid game but the fear of being stuck into a bad build stopped me from exploring multiple avenues. But thats about it for my review. I give this game a 9.8/10 Its super good, but not perfect.
First run is a wonderful experience. subsequent runs feel tiring do to unneeded openworld element.
awful multiplayer system, have to use items to play together and the host is the only one that can do or complete anything to incude talking to npc's. by far the worst as a solo game maybe its good but i did not buy it for that , i got it to play with friends and thats a bust
I've played for about 5 hours or so. Most games i would have already finished by now. However, I just defeated the first mini boss. Don't get this game if you don't have the patience to play it. Sometimes you will go hours at a time not progressing at all. I think it's rewarding at the end but if you just want your average game to relax and pass time this is not for you. Great game and i'm having a blast playing it.
good
Shit's good. Worth the hype.
I dunno, after i update the latest version the game was crashed often i'm using RTX3050
amazing, introduced me to souls game
The game you'll be trash at, but still love it. One of the best souls - like games ever. You will love the open world design and difficulty. The combat is rewarding and dynamic with a wonderful discovery loop.
GOATED GAME
Gud Game 
Targeting in this game is trash having to move the whole mouse to switch between targets is horrible i play games so much my mind moves the mouse on its own and the when I'm fighting randomly switch targets i liked dark souls 3 targeting just scroll wheel up and it switches now the game is good but theirs no way to change the controls for targeting the most your going to get is auto targeting
it was game of the year I do not need to explain why
This is a great game.  Haven't played a souls game for a while and this was a great introduction back into this style of games. There are a lot of different play styles and each is capable of finishing the game, meaning lots of replay ability without it feeling stale after each completion.   If you are new to the souls style of games and want to start some where, I would start with Elden Ring.
I only simp for Ranni
I am more maidenless than I was before 10/10
it is a game, though difficult 
pain ahead.
very fun game dont play it (･ω･)b
fun
10/10
as close to perfect as you can get  this is the best game created by far
dex bleed
its fun
great game i hope you agree
T'is quite good
Badass game
its pretty good
Radagon is a sexy mf
Very beautiful and fun open world
Probably the greatest game I've ever played. The sheer scope of the world and the lore in it is mesmerizing. I can't fathom how they managed to piece everything together so well, the atmosphere, the combat, the music, it all clicks and works together seamlessly. The voice actors, the scenery and the boss fights are all awe inspiring to the extent that it's hard to put in words.   I can't remember the last time i felt such childlike joy when discovering something new or unexpected, that I do in this game in every game session.   10/10 simply a masterpiece
do you hate yourself? then dont buy this game.  do you not hate yourself? buy this game and learn to hate yourself its so worth it! 
Yes, fucking amazing game. Get it
A mix of frustration and pure fun! This game really lived up to its initial hype!
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'
Great game
=D
quit before u play too much. game made me gay.
Epic
badass
The game is great but I have issues with quality of life stuff like menus and mouse-keyboard-support.
10/10
it was okay
I'm here to say nothing.
Huge world, great art, custom builds.  Modern Skyrim with a challenge, I wish there was more engaging story to it.  Not much replay value though and stat respec is limited.  Still worth buying for world exploration.
I bought Elden Ring along with Persona 5 Royal. Both made me cry for different reasons. 10/10
if you find godskin duo hard it might be because you have a skill issue not because design is bad
fun
[i] ITALIANS [/i] 
pretty sure I'm questioning reality and my controller has endured more pain than i can speak about but would recommend
Its a great game and by far the best game of 2022, but it is literally just a worse version of Dark Souls.   Elden Ring takes all the problems I have with Dark Souls and makes them bigger problems, while the only thing it really improves on is the graphics, which this game has absolutely beautiful graphics.   I would recommend playing Elden Ring at some point, but if you don't have a lot of money, you would be much better off just buying Dark Souls Remastered and the rest of the trilogy then coming back to Elden Ring later if you enjoyed them.
died in the title screen
If you like other fromsoftware games you'll most likely enjoy elden ring. It's pretty much what you'd expect. Overall 8/10 I'll keep playing for years to come most likely.
AWESOME
Yes
An absolute masterpiece.
"The best worst decision you will ever make."
pretty easy compared to other souls game. really good game for newbs.
cannot sex the maiden
Beware of dog
bought this game like 5 days ago and ive already got 60 hours playtime, almost completed the game for the first time, such a well made game. More than worth your money, even in 2023.
Nice
Excellent game!
THE BEST BUT HARD
Probably one of the best content/money ratio you can find, and that's not even accounting for the amazing gameplay and (subjectively) fun pvp aspects.
I had always attempted to play Souls game, but would never have the patience to learn and practice (there were always port performance issues too at that). So I waited until a smooth experience on PC and without knowing it sank 11 hours into this game! I feel people who are on the fence should really untrain a lot of traditional AAA games' perspectives and quirks and relearn what this game has to offer. I'm probably going to working backwards on all the previous titles. There goes 1000 hrs more!
+120 hrs on other account  Maiden is nowhere to be found. Time is an abstract linguistic concept. Thoughts linger. Where? No. What is reality? rea... li..  
Fucking amazing!!!!
i got maidens :)
my friend plays thius game if you were weondering.. i do too lol!
102 hours and still feel like i barely explored the game so far love it
yes
Fall joke
I sitll haven't beaten it yet...
ouch
bruh wtf is an Elden Ring?
Best souls game ever.
Lowly Tarnished....Thou'rt unfit even to graft.... -like 50 times my first playthrough.  Good game.
i like the way my go-nads tingle defeating an enemy
my head hurts after spending too much time on this game
Do I even need to say anything? 
very kewl
to hard goofy 
Oh my God, it's full of stars..... This game is everything.
I LOVE this game!! One of the best I have ever played! <3
Rise, tarnished
too easy
IT GOOD
i changed my review just bc i learned how to play now game good
Incredible game and worth fully supporting the people who made it!
Did not deliver any experience that was enjoyable
Very hard game, but I'm sure you already knew that.
The most visually interesting open-game I've ever played.
Good game
i love the game like any adventure game yes. back then i didn't love it couple months ago because I mostly loved god of war series from 1 to ragnarok
amazing game, more like a journey
 best rpg ever made.
all it needs is a sex update
beautiful game, very hard. my seconds souls type game, enjoyed it a lot. love the cosmetics and scenery as well.
very cool 
believe it or not, the game is good
This game go burrrrr. smile
لعبه جميله
can i return this product please, thank you
Fun
Fuck this game, to fucking inconsistent, some fights are fucking amazing, other are fucking epic trash.  Some bosses have cool mechanics and are fun to try during hours, but some others are to much bull shit and inconsistency, and some bosses are RNG based, example Dragonlord Placidusax is a very bad designed boss, is super boring to play vs ...  And the more you advance on the game the easy it gets, fuck it.  Some builds are broken AF, other ones are unplayable ...  If you have a lot of time buy it, if not, pass this game
great game 
[h1] A must play, but only if you have the time [/h1]  I had preordered the game and played around 80 hours in the first month alone. I was absolutely hooked. If I had written a review back then, I would have without a doubt, given it a 10/10.  The world, the mechanics, the graphics are masterfully crafted and I don't think I have something new to say about these. However, I had put a pause on gaming for around half a year not because I didn't want to play but because of the lack of time - a predicament most people can relate to.  These weeks have been a little bit more free for me, so I thought - "I must download Elden Ring, how much I miss it!"  I jumped back into the lands between excited to continue my adventure - only to find out I have absolutely no recollection of what I was doing before, what quests I have picked up and where to go.  I was left stumbled and found little to no enjoyment in slaying enemies with a character I remember nothing about... Which is a shame. I'm not saying a quest log and markers like Skyrim's or The Witcher 3 would have made the game better - even the opposite. But a Morrowind style diary about who you met, what they told you and what you did would have avoided this problem altogether - while preserving the direction of the game.   In the end - I would recommend Elden Ring to everyone who has time to play it every week. If you are a casual gamer with not too much time - save your money for another RPG or wait until you can dedicate your time to finish this masterpiece (What I will be doing)    
An absolute dream of a game for new souls players and old
tem nem oq ve, so vai.
This game is the GOART
My first souls game. It's a very good game. The world is captivating and epic. The graphics are good but on close inspection they aren't at the same level as other AAA games, although the art style makes up for it MASSIVELY. I don't think any other game has made dark high fantasy look this good, the world and the atmosphere feels like you're in a painting. The game is challenging as per the norm for soulsbornes but due to the large open spaces and ability to run away from MOST situations, the game gives you a lot of freedom to play and level up at your own pace. I've heard from some "Souls" elitists that it is not perfect and that the other games do some things better, but that is to be expected that no game is perfect. This is a massive open world and there are some areas of tedious and repetitive content, many mini dungeons are samey and some mini-bosses are boring the second or third time you fight a variant. Still, I highly recommend buying Elden Ring. It's something every gamer should experience.
Casual maiden based dating sim with some exploration encouraged. Lots of dogs but not all of them are fluffy if that is a deal breaker. Similar to Stardew Valley. Would recommend for anyone that likes farming games or text based adventures.
A game that could have been. One of the greatest disappointments I've played recently. It's a fine game 7/10 but it lacks any development of base mechanics and is terribly unbalanced. Too long and too big for its own good.
Not bad, but its not a spiritual successor to darksouls. Its a bit bright and happy for my taste but thats fine.
The game is incredible for players that are new to souls games.  It is difficult enough where you have to think about what to do and where you want to go, but difficult enough to the point where you would want to pull your hair out. (Most of the Time).  Very good game that I would recommend for newer players and older players alike.
gud
its just good
Malenia
Best game
Everyone already knows how good Elden Ring is. The Seamless Co-op mod takes it from good to absolutely outstanding.
I HATE THIS GAME  THis game kills you in ONE HIT  The tracking in this is better than ever, the mobs and bosses know when im being a distant bitch and when im healing, they can close distances in a second and then they bonk me.  THERE IS VERY many weapons many weapon arts, endless weab cosplay galor. The true challenge of this game is beat it as stylish as possible  This game big... no seriously this game BIIIG the map be fluffy lvl big. The atmosphere felt so nice,finding random areas was jaw dropping,  i cant even explain the visuals and art that this game presents.  I love this game, is it difficult? you can choose how difficult you want it to be, with the much more fluid multiplayer system and big player base you can beat it. The checkpoints in this game are much more lenient than previous titles.   The series has Helped me control my emotional anger over the years, good game get bragging rights after I Guess praise the sun. Much more fluid than the first 3, and every thing is shinier.  if your seriously struggling look up how to get moonveil or reduvia dagger, find one of the banished knight summons. look up how to upgrade those, prioritize vigor.  
funny magic stick go brrrrrrrrrrr
There is a woman who will hug you anytime you want - 10/10
Highly Recommend!
amazing
good game, well once you get good at it
Incredible game , never run out of things to do?
Game of the Decade.
yes
Praise the game
A game that I will tell my grandkids about.
Good game faithfull to the ds series
This is the first of the souls games that I've ever played. It was slap in the face to say the least to begin with but after I got past the initial shock I absolutely loved it!!
This will likely be a useless review to most, however there is not much to say. Simply Brilliant.
100 Hrs and i still only managed to beat 3 bosses
Game of the year every year
I spent 66 hours on my first play thru. If you hate your life and want to forget why you hate it go ahead and buy it
 Once I learned how to play, I beat Soldier of Godrick on hour 17. The game cannot be harder than this I swear. 10/10
its a great game
one of the best games
A great Soulsborn game. I love the freedom you have in making the character you want to play. It feels like there is no optimal way. Just what works for you.
Love Love Love this game. It was super hard when I first started but within around 20 hrs I got my bearings. The lack of story from the start intrigued me to find out more. The difficultly kept me playing short and long term. The fighting mechanics are great! The Graphics are great! Button mapping is genius. Overall, I would give this game a 10/10 on every category even replay-ability.
i love it  
if you are looking for maidens don't buy this game, but if you want to beat a boss who looks like a homeless dude then this game is for you definitely worth 60 bucks
 Good game
Yes lad!
+++ Beautiful game, I love it doesnt GPS you to every objective.  Thank you for making a game that rewards exploration :)
Amazing game
Awesome
Elden Ring has a special place in my heart.
I thought this game was hard until I created a bleed build.
I highly recommend the game .  Elden Ring is a masterpiece on open world sandbox and the gameplay  is spot on . and the bosses god damn hard
Hot take: game is good
Amazing 
best game of the year
Steam asked me if I'd recommend this game. I completely forgot to give this underappreciated gem a thumbs up.
Many hours spent in this open world game. So many variables and permutations that should keep any avid gamer happy for many hours.
If you're a fan of fantasy of any kind, or breathe oxygen, you will love this game. 10/10 easily (and I'm a narcissist so I don't say that often). 
Fun game but also can piss you off really easy. takes time and paintents that a lot of people dont have but if you do have it this is deffently for you! I love it and hope yall do 2
so guuuuuuud!
If you can imagine a build in Elden Ring, you can most likely make it. PVE is amazing, PVP is slowly improving. Can't wait for the DLC
Truly one of the best games I've ever played. Frustrating at times, but totally worth it.
I wish I can be born again, just to play this game again for the first time.
It is not bad, but after playing Dark Souls, this is all the same and even does not feel better than previous ones. Bosses are unbeatable when not playing coop. I uninstalled this game. It is boring to me.
best game ever
Elden Ring is an amazing tale of a man, clueless about his calling, on a murderous rampage across the land, accompanied by his imaginary girlfriend, keeper of a thousand armaments but knows only how to use two, defying the gods, ultimately controlling the fate of the Lands Between by following the many convoluted paths written in the Elden Ring wiki. 10/10. Best Roll Playing Game indeed. 
much worse
It's perfect.
Game is challenging. You die a lot but its pretty fun
This game is an abusive relationship, and i am willingly staying in it
"Elden Ring ahead"
bad at first but gets amazing id pay over 70 quid for it now 
best open world rpg ive ever played.
Still stuttering like nothing else. Kills the combat completely

It's quite good; a great deal of content for the price.
Awesome
pretty good hard to learn 
So good
praise the sun

This game physically hurts me
anything for the lunar blue cunny
Elden Ring isn't a perfect game, that much is known. I had some technical issues while playing the game (frame stuttering and the occasional crash), but to say that this isn't one of the best games I've played would be as much of a cardinal scene as [spoiler]burning the damn Erdtree[/spoiler].  Now, I'm a complete newbie to souls-likes. Actually, that's not entirely true because I've played Dark Souls 3, however I've never actually completed the game. Elden Ring was the first game I fully completed and gotten every ending for, so here's my take from a completely newbie standpoint.  I found the lore engrossing, which doesn't happen with me every often. The last time I had enjoyed a good story was deltarune and UNDERTALE respectively. A lot of the characters were three-dimensional and ripe with personality, and I particularly loved every single boss on a design standpoint. I'd say that Placidusax and Fortissax were my favorite, but they're both dragons and I have a dragon bias, so I'll say that Malenia's and Elden Beast's designs were my unbiased favorite.  Combat's challenging, that much is obvious. It's a souls game, I wouldn't expect any hand holding, but it's not difficult to the point where its unfair. You have to seriously time your attacks and dodges just so you're sure you don't come crashing face first into Renalla's moon. You actually have to plan ahead and think instead of rushing in and spamming your ash of war until the enemy drops. Sure, Mohg has the non-preventable nihil attack that procs with blood loss three times, but there's a whole crystal tear meant to counter it. Even then, you can literally survive without it by simply healing every time he procs it. The only one I found a little bit unfair was Malenia's waterfowl dance, but since it's been almost a year since the game's launch, there's already a method to dodge it.  Let's also not forget the open-world aspect of this game. I've gotten all the achievements the game had to offer. Still, even after all of that, after all 114 hours of playing, there's still undiscovered catacombs, caves, questlines, bosses...  The music is great. Don't really need to explain that one.  Overall, 10/10, would experience the game again.
100% must play
10 out of 10 masterpiece
i don't know what i'm doing lol
best open world game ever!!!!
So much content to explore, massive build diversity and punishing but satisfying combat mechanics. A breath of fresh air to the open world genre giving the player an unguided experience rarely seen these days.  100% worth a squirt!
better than ocarina of time. 10/10- lots to do
180 hours with newgame 2 and all achievements investment.  Overall great open world game. If you like souls like games you'll like this game. The open world itself was very full of life and differences, the areas each having their own flare. The main bosses were all unique characters. Side bosses had some repeats, but with so many bosses its not too surprising and can be forgiven though. its an area of improvement. Difficulty was dynamic depending on how good your build is and what your current level is. There is also lots of help to make the bosses easier like ashes.  The npcs you meet along the way are all interesting and none ever felt same in personality. The weapons and abilities available add a lot of dynamics to combat. If I had to ask for one thing to be done a little better, it would be in the endings. [spoiler] 4 of the 6 possible endings [/spoiler] are a bit samey and uninspired because of that.  I'd say its a 9/10. Well worth the money paid for it. I also didn't play for a few months since the game came out, so I didn't experience any optimization issues I hear mentioned.
complete crap!
Epic
haha mage go brrrrr
Good game
Graphics 9/10 Story 10/10 Dungeon Design 7/10 World Design 10/10 Music 10/10 All Bosses 8/10 Gameplay 10/10 (it's dark souls) First play through was by far the most fun, but i beat this game 7 times and going on my 8th. When you first play you are new and everything is a new discovery and everything would have been a 10. Once you do the caves and the catacombs you start to see that its mostly the same but of course with some slight gimmick or trick but it came down to here is another dungeon and boss with a spirit ash as a reward. Bosses were all great but its not a 10 due to using bosses more then once but they do change them a little. The arena is what i do a lot of now to get good at my builds and tweak them to get really good at duels.
good
Worth to buy
cool game
killed big dragon after only 40 attempts soo easy
gh
If you played other souls series you probably gonna like dis one :*
one of the games ever
i hate this fucking game. A 8.5/10 experience
Elden Ring 👍
Great game many deaths
I think it's the best game ever, amazing combat, animations, variety in the world, very very diffucult but no impossible. The only thing is that I don't see the point in playing it again through since you already have killed the bosses and collected the items.
very good
its good
I was never want to get lost in a big world so much. The best point is everywhere you can see is also reachable simultaneously, which excites me.
GOTY 2022
Open world dark souls 👍
Good
AFTER MANY HOURS IN THIS I CAN NOW CONCLUDE I AM IN LOVE WITH JACOB, IBRAHIM, ANTHONY AND JOSH. I AM MAIDENLESS BUT I HAVE 4 PEN/ISES ENTERY MY ANA/ L CAVITY

shtabby shtab
Damn, these Rings be Elden
fun game but multiplayer system could be improved
great
this game is like minecraft. the only differences are that it is not a block game and is nothing like minecraft
One of the best games I've every played. I couldn't stop playing.
been stuck on the tutorial boss for years. 10/10
i love this game 
Bonk things to give you things to then bonk more things to then give you even more things to then bonk some more things to then become Elden Lord
.
One of the best games that I have played to date. Got me into the rest of the souls titles as well, a great entry point into FromSoftware's library of souls like games. Incredible lore, great graphics, good mechanics. Yes, there are issues, and the pvp isn't great like ds3 was. But still a very solid game. In total I do highly recommend this and Dark Souls 3 if you haven't played either of them.
need head
191 hours and I can positively say that i'll probably surpass 500. What an incredible game.
good game 
What I liked: pretty much the entire game was fun for the most part, exploring and taking your time building your level and finding different armors and weapons to use is great. The beginning bosses are pretty decent. Love having a horse to get around, combat can either be great while on Torrent or awful. I do love the game, I completed it three times to get all 42 achievements.  What I did not like: Later bosses, for me, are not fun to fight. It feels good to defeat them but I was also exhausted and still frustrated even though I beat them. I will admit I am not strong at combat and with one boss I had a cooperator help me so I could get the achievement. I do not feel bad about it! Later game also has sparse interactions with regular combat and felt like I just went from one boss and on to another with very little inbetween. I felt there was less to do in regard to exploring in later game, which was a shame as the setting would have been great for it.  Regardless, I would recommend this game. Probably on controller, I played on keyboard and mouse and it was a challenge. If you get discouraged easily or frustrated with dying there is multiplayer as well. Good luck becoming Elden Lord!
be weary of finger
An amazing Game, and visually stunning, while tough it is amazing fun!
best game clearly peak gameplay deserved the goty. Malenia goated don't search her up if you don't know just wait till the end

This has got to be one of the best games ever made.
I'm addicted
I think this game could have been really fun for me but as this is my first souls game it was difficult getting started. If this is your first souls game i would recommend watching some youtube videos as I did to help get started. But I feel like this should already be integrated in the game for newer players. Even finding the tutorial cave was a bit difficult. Especially for a made to be difficult game they should of had a better tutorial start in my opinion. I am not saying its a bad game but it does have a bad tutorial start, it felt like I was playing outward all over again ;/ oh well...
it gud
Great Game, a MUST HAVE is the Seamless MP Mod, and it becomes soooo much more fun to cram in endless hours with friends.
this game is very good. I received it for my birthday; a month later, 100 hours.
its like dark souls but open world
Top 5 games ive ever played in my life 
Excellent gameplay Excellent balance Many options Responsive controls Skill requirement is not too high for a casual person to enjoy it Stories and adventure Art
Definitely the of all time

Greatest game ever made, no one can argue with me on that, my only regret with playing this was the amount of stuff I just used guides for. I'm not a very patient person, so when I don't do something or find something, I find a way around it, e.g., a guide. But this was a game I shouldn't have used any guides on. And I will forever hate myself for that, but even so, this game is still incredible. 10/10
cool game to chill on with friends
I mean, it won GOTY for a reason, right? Solid game with fun combat and weapon systems and a beautiful open world. I've restarted at least a dozen times and the view once you first step into the open world is breathtaking every time. With 5 being average, this game is an 8/10. If you haven't played a FromSoft game before, or if you did but felt like the learning curve would be too much of a time-sink, I would strongly recommend giving this one a shot.
pretty easy game
Get Maidens, get weapons, kill bosses and start fires 10/10 Game  Malenia blade of Miquella why are you the way that you are???????? 10/10 reasons to die  Momm- Ranni...  hi hello <3
I love this game so much,this game is  much better then God of war Ragnarok
Elden Ring is definitely my game of the year for 2022. Took me about 220 hours and three playthroughs to get 100% achievements and was worth the time. There is so much to do, you never get bored. As per From Software's history, the story is obscure but rewards exploring. There are also a variety of ways to play. You can play as a hack and slash type, sword and board, pure spellcaster, or some unique combination that fits your gear or play-style.
Very slow, but hard
i am the elden lord
I like it. It has a lot of flaws but it also has a lot to like. It is also very different from Fromsoft's other souls like games and is best approached as a different experience to them.
Beautiful game with an intricate and compelling story.  It's challenging, but so rewarding to finish.
First time playing a souls game, I've got 94 hours in so far, and it's the most recent game I've played that I'm not tired of after playing for a few hours, and I am sure I will be playing this for a long time, gotta get good!
I've been playing for 4 days pls help me
hard but fun
Hands down one of the absolute best games i have ever played.  you can lose yourself for hours.
:)
Fort, knight
game aight
good game
I'd love to play more, but I can't recommend it yet because I'm one of the PC players that is experiencing constant, annoying slow down/speed up stuttering, and to me it is maddening. I've played lots of games, including recent graphics-intensive games, and don't have any problems with any of them (so I don't really believe it's a problem with my computer). Anyways, I've tried every solution I can find to no avail -- to the point where I've decided I'll just wait to see if there's ever a patch, etc. Anyways, the game world is captivating and really fun to explore. I hope I get the chance to experience it with the buttery-smooth goodness I so deeply deserve. :)
The car crashed for some reason
pretty mid
Just freaking support Dualsense controllers. The vibration still does not work. For one of the biggest titles, please just devote one hour into fixing this. Tiring and frustrating.
g oated
GOOD GAME
This is not a game, it's art.
Masterpiece
Loved the open world, dungeons were 50/50 but one of the best souls games for beginners.
Died too many times to count. come die with us.
I love this game so much, I swear to God. I was introduced to Souls games by a good friend of mine, but truth be told, it was I who got Elden Ring first. As soon as I saw YouTubers playing it, I copped it almost IMMEDIATELY. I gave up a few times, sure. It was my first Souls game after all. But after a few stumbles and encouragements from my friend, I got sucked into the game like crumbs to a vacuum. It's one of my favorite games of all time, if not my MOST favorite. The open world, the scenery, the boss fights, the lore (oh, God, the lore..), they're all so nuts to me, and I'm just in love with this conduction of chaos From has made. Only thing I wish were changed, however, is that the Godskin Duo fight was a fight that had coordinated attacks, rather than the two just doing their own thing and jamming their weapons in my face. Then again, it is a Souls games, and those are never easy.
fuck maliketh.
One of a kind.
Good game, very fun
Great game. worth more than wat u pay because of how much time u will spend finding everything. also sexy fucking armor
Greatest RPG game i ever played
Meskuter Pekos Skurmera Dengus 👍
Perfect game
very good game 
John Darksoul hath returnith.
The huge range of builds and types of ways to play the game, as well as how Elden ring creates replay-ability with the N+ system is absolutely phenomenal, I do not have the most hours on the game but it is the first single player game I want to keep playing.
nice
It's a great game!
Finally a Complete game
Try Finger, But Hole.
Malenia is the worst designed boss From has ever made

its litty tiddy but youre gonna wanna die
Been hooked on for a while, only thing is if you play this game expect no type of help
ELDEN PEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ELDEN RING™ is just DARK SOULS™ with extra steps, [i]literally[/i], you have to transverse three times as much digital terrain than previous FROMSOFTWARE games (multiply that by two if you're doing co-op, because then you can't use the horsie), much of which is filled with barely anything of worth, many of the starting bosses are later then recycled in evergaols (Godrick equals Godefroy) and you'll see the same mini-bosses or [i]field bosses[/i] as the game calls them every two or three Site of Graces, like the death chicken or the ominous bell knight. Limgrave and Liurnia are very pleasing areas to explore and lose yourself in, they break away from the usual gloomy-depression-inducing-dark-fantasy settings From Software is known for and that is a plus, but soon you'll get thrown in Caelid and the dungeons will remember you which series this hails from. The dungeons are all samey, you get in, beat up some small stone imps and deal with the usual firethrower mechanism or the riding chariot of death and then you find a lever and kill a [i]field boss[/i] and you're good to go — back to just running around with your horse. The NPCs can move their mouths while talking now, that's something that took them a while — I understand. Despite all these gripes I have, I still had fun in a way I didn't really felt with one of their titles since playing DARK SOULS II: Scholar of the First Sin. So it's got that going for it, which is nice.

Doesn't have as much replay value as the other souls games but still a wonderful experience

One of the greatest games i have ever played, it is such a huge game that it is impossible to comprehend how much content is held in a 50 gig download. Highly recommend for anyone into the God of War franchise or anyone who enjoys soulslikes all around. By far some of FromSofts best work.
fuckin great
Bosses repeat x times true the game, catacombs often looks and feels the same. Lot of thinks in this games are just copy pasted for "more" content. In the end you're doing same thing over and over again, but in the different places. Very lazy, surely I can more recommend Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 3. Very sad. I would prefer smaller game without so often repetation.
Skill issue
- can't play 2 mins without the game crashing - capped at 60 fps
Top notch story and world, love it
Nice👍

fun but hard

This is a true RPG. Incredible story and world that needs to be discovered through game play. No special tricks or shortcuts, this is a game that can be played in almost any way you choose. The most rewarding game play experience I've ever had.
its a good game  :)
We're going to Beijing boys ;)
My girlfriend and family miss me dearly

First playthrough is amazing, the world is well-realized and fun to explore.  Significantly less fun on every subsequent playthrough compared to every other Fromsoft souls-like game, really just turns into riding the mount around for way, way too long.    100% difficulty: Easy 100% time: Medium  If you can beat the game and all its bosses, you can get 100%.  It will require multiple playthroughs though, which isn't much fun
Good + pot boy
Just remember, you are not the main character, whichever boss your fighting is though
is good game
veri veri
Very Nice 10/10

Game doesn't get easier. You get better. Love it.

NIHIL NIHIL NIHIL
Elden Ring operates on one simple idea: You, a weak and frail nobody, have to rise to the occasion and slay hideous monsters, gigantic dragons, legendary kings, ancient gods, and even ferocious madness-inflicting rats in order to accomplish your goals.  This is quickly and efficiently established as you unsuspectingly start the game and immediately get splattered across the walls by a sword wielding, acid spewing spider made out of corpses. You have now discovered that you're in a brutal and apathetic environment that will try to kill you regardless of your complaints.  When you mull over that synopsis, what comes to mind? It sounds unfair, doesn't it? Every aspect of the game is specifically designed to be an obstacle against your progress that you have to overcome, to the point of feeling unfair at many points. And at some points, it is actually unfair. But the task this game demands of you is to put your boots on and push through every obstacle until you finally overcome them, leading to a feeling of accomplishment that wouldn't be there if you just beat the boss in one try.  The basic framework of the gameplay is deceivingly simple, you either attack your enemy, or dodge their attack, but in actuality you will have to consider many aspects like positioning, health and stamina, length and moveset of your weapon, and learn to avoid fatal beginner mistakes like overcommitting on your attacks or panic dodges that get easily punished by your enemies.  The map of the game is truly massive, it is the one of the few, perhaps even the only detailed video game environments that provides a true sense of scale. You see that giant tree? That's not the skybox, that's where you're going. Over the course of the game you will traverse massive lakes, great forests, gargantuan castles, deep and ancient underground cities, and mountainous mountains. Elden Ring succeeds where most open world games fail by being a vertical game, you will be able to visit the highest heights and the lowest depths.  Unfortunately, due to the scale of the world, from a loot perspective exploration is not rewarded nearly as well as previous Fromsoft games. In Dark Souls when you searched through the cracks and crevices of a location off the beaten path you would end up finding a cool sword or armor set, but in Elden Ring it's more likely to be a mushroom for crafting. While this is a valid complaint it's also simply not feasible for the developers to have gone and placed unique items at every little hidden cliffside or dead end. But if you personally enjoy exploration for its own sake and seeing the incredible sights of the game then you won't have any problems.  The most controversial aspect of the game is the multiplayer. The way it works is that you can summon friends into your game to explore together and help you fight enemies. The co-op can be a bit inconvenient because the game doesn't let you go between separate map areas in multiplayer, and it doesn't let you use your horse in multiplayer either.  The part where people are divided though is the invasion system. When you are playing with friends, another player can invade your world and attempt to kill you in order to halt your progress. Many people buy Fromsoft games thinking that they are exclusively a PvE experience and then encounter invaders and it leaves a sour taste in their mouth. The problems people have with invaders range from simply not enjoying having their progress halted by another person, to many invaders using broken meta weapons that are very difficult to counter.  To me, this issue with invaders is closely related to the core philosophy of the game. Just like a difficult boss, invaders are yet another obstacle to your quest that the game mercilessly throws at you. Invaders also have their own obstacles, the game throws teams of 2-3 people at them and they have to be good enough to handle the pressure and use their environment as an advantage in their war of attrition. From the invader's perspective, the host and their summons are the boss that must be overcome.  Though I prefer the gameplay, in my opinion as a whole the PvP in this game is a step down from Dark Souls 3. The previous games had a system called covenants, which were essentially factions that a player could choose that had unique matchmaking and item rewards for co-op and PvP. This system is only just barely present in Elden Ring, and it's watered down. Even in the previous games the rewards for multiplayer weren't that good but now you essentially get nothing except for a good time. The only thing resembling a covenant left in the game are the white and blue cipher rings that respectively allow you to call for help from another player whenever you get invaded or respond to that call for help.  TLDR: This game sucks you in and transports you into a brutal yet beautiful world of fantasy, borrowing heavily from Lord of The Rings and Berserk. 10/10 would solo her again.

Very nice.
The best game I've played the past 10 years. Simply amazing. Every part of this game feels like stepping into a painting.
yes.

Elden Ring.
This is by far one of the better games that I have played. This ranks right up there with The Last of Us for me. It's not the story part that is awesome because the lore in Elden Ring is very vague; it's just so much fun. It's very hard to describe what it is about this game but I love it. This is my first venture into a Souls type game and it is fantastic.
best
Good Game
wow very rage inducing but my int + dex build will stop the rage :)
my original review of this game was negative it still is mostly is negative for early game but first basically everything about the games Graphics & Audio are outstanding like most AAA titles but where we fall flat is  game play and grind theirs SO MUCH GRIND and game play is a lot of being perfect theirs no room for you to make a mistake shit theirs basically no room to even hit when you do everything perfectly as you get latter into the game aka almost all the way threw it it starts getting better but it still is do everything perfect and get 1 hit off before needing to doge an entire 10 hit combo just for them to not let you attack after this game thrives off of multiplayer and having a tanky overlevled friend help you out by drawing agro like i said games worth but only if you REALLY injoy the series of darksouls like games i would never recomend this game to a person of a more casual status even if they were super competive usuly if your considering getting eldenring and its your first soulslike maybe consider darksouls 3
.
Best game ever
Gud
YES
245 hours with the playthrough where I finally actually full-cleared the game taking me 60. There was frustration, and there was joy when I finally overcame obstacles I would be stuck on. And all for the price of a couple of meals out somewhere half decent.  Value is absolutely through the roof. Hopefully one day they'll bring some DLC for it. I found the game to be best enjoyed as a slow burn, going through all side dungeons I came across and exploring whatever random side paths I could think of.  10/10 do strongly recommend
Okay, what I'm about to review is in no way hyperbolic and should be taken as an incentive to play the damn game: it's a work of brilliance that does everything utterly right. From the scarcely comprehensible plot, to the graphics and atmosphere, to the loot, level and combat system, everything is on the utmost level. The game is unsurprisingly tough, but for a valid reason: you despair of bosses, and to overcome them you simply have to improve; so the game pushes you to be a better, smarter and stronger player, and once you realize that, it's even more rewarding. When you finally defeat the Elden Beast after 100 tries, you have literally become a god at Elden Ring, and you look back mischievously to the start when you originally believed the first boss was unconquerable. Unsurprisingly, Elden Ring has become GOTY. Congrats!

Best open-world game built so far.
Spent half my playtime tryna find my way through stormveil
One of the best games ever made.
What I like best is learning the enemy patterns. There is a consistent logic to the combat system (attack, delayed attack, etc). You really get into the flow of things when you see the underlying system.
Wow. I purchased Elden Ring with the expectation that I would never play again after the first 2 hours. I am now 38 hours into the game and I am hooked! This is my first From Software game and the difficulty lives up to the hype. Personally, I find the difficulty of the game is refreshing and makes overcoming obstacles feel so rewarding. It is challenging but fair. I love the different ways you get to build your character from the ground up in your quest for power and prestige. Additionally, the graphics and art style are breathtaking! This is one dark fantasy adventure that I cannot recommend enough!
60fps on title screen  15fps ingame   👍  
awersome
Masterpiece.
One of best experiences ever. Best Art, interesting story, A music and atmosphere really beauty.  Great "open" world game that you can do a lot a lot of things. Really fun to play suit for the name Game of the year.  You maybe afraid because It easy to die and feel hard but...don't afraid...this game teach you to throwaway a life for accomplished what you want. when death is nothing an unlimited life is your best weapon. gain unlimited experiences and fun with your adventure. Rise tarnished.
get good kid
This game is everything a game should be.   - Complete on day one. - Difficult but also easy to conquer. Once you master and beat a boss, the sense of satisfaction is beyond words. - No hand-holding and checkpoint bull. A true open world that can be explored at your own pace and level. - Even the side missions are eventful and you'll remember them. - A fantasy world that you will relate to after so many deaths and the emotion and music and graphics, everything is just bliss! - No micro-transactions, no p2w. A good game with enough for at least 150 hours and replay ability for years.   Miyazaki and the FromSoft team, take a bow. You show the world how games are supposed to be made.  Eagerly waiting for the next.
Just O M G ...
You could be Wolverine, Guts or even Kratos. Yes, I change my build every day. Best gamer ever. 
Absolutely amazing game! So many different ways to play it. Not as hard as people say if you make a proper build. I recommend it to anyone! 
69 Nice
Had issues with the frame rate originally and got refused a refund from steam as i had played it for too long whilst trying to get it to work.  Although I think steam was completely out of order I have since managed to get the game working and it is awesome (obviously)  just seems  a little bit susceptible to system issues that other games aren't.
Elden Ring got me gooder than ive already had to get gud for in previous titles. I love the rage and accomplishments. Play the game at least once if you like games
 Immersive, expansive, and challenging. 10/10
thanks Formsoft, thanks to Elden Ring I can implement crazy ideas in the mod version

Tarnished had a little goat
Dark Souls 3 on steroids!
Perfect game
Very disappointing. Clear lack of purpose of what's going on, controls not intuitive, unable to pause game. Steep learning curve, unsure of what the character is even supposed to be doing in the game. Lack of story.
Maidenless
Best advice I have received for this game: If you ever don't know what to do? Get lost!
One of the best games ive played in the last ten years hands down 10 out of 10  
THE FAT MAN ROLLS!
10/10

All I can say is git gud lol.
Over 60 hours spent in game and i still cant beat the soldier of Godrick how do they expect people to like a game like this when the first boss is unbeatable L game + ratio
maidens required ahead
New comer to the Dark Souls Saga. I love every bit of it. Looking forward to future productions.
Try finger But, hole
its a game i dont usually play but i really enjoy it
it good
game got game of the year for no reason it sucks recycled enemies the whole time was fun for maybe an hour then i had basically seen all the enemies n bosses. No point in playing the rest they just recycle every single enemy and boss. Plus most of the fights are straight boring just have the boss spamming the same move over n over doing the same voice lines over n over. Wasted way to much time of my life hoping it would get better just to see why it won game of the year but guess what it never got better. Never got fun. never left limgrave basically
Great game
amaing
classic!
Great
amazing, so much content u wont regret buying it even if ur not into souls
try finger but, hole
YeS iS GOOd video gamE
Good game!
Have 500 hours on console. First blind playthrough was one of, if not the greatest game I have ever played. On subsequent playthroughs, riding from place to place is the only boring part.

theres a dude called dung eater
Arise ye tarnished!
Absolute banger of a game. I recommend that anyone who isn't feeling the game at first to just try to keep playing because the game just gets better and bigger as you keep going.   Also make sure to read dialogue and info item descriptions.
For such an amazingly breathtaking game, it sucks ass. the fall damage and mob damage are so inconsistent you would think this game was made 15 years ago if it werent for the graphics. FromSoft is notorious for making an amazing game, then not fixing anything important. You wanna use your magical, gravity defying horse to jump down 5 feet? Death awaits you, you wanna jump down a 100ft drop with no magical double jump horse? You'll prob live bc fuck it, if you like other fromsoft games I would get it but holy hell be ready to lose your sanity over the most mind-boggling dumb shit.
p
made me mad
I'm a bit of a cheapskate, not to mention my taste in video games tends to steer me away from the $60 triple-a titles. I'm also not usually the biggest fan of open world games either. They often tend to have way too much wide open space or have a bunch of boring npcs with even more boring quests. However I enjoyed Dark Souls III enough to take a gamble on this one. I'm very glad I did. This game respects my monkey brain of "I wanna run around and kill stuff" more than any other open world or RPG ever has. While the large set pieces are the stars of the show, likely due to their more linear dark souls-y design, the open areas still have plenty of activities, and the exploration feels very organic, so it never feels like going from point A to point B, but rather "that building in the distance sure looks interesting, I'll head in that general direction while checking out stuff on the side." I feel like my $60 has already been worth it, and I've barely made a dent in this game.  Edit: 60 hours in and I do have a few criticisms.  1. The pvp kinda sucks. There's no more random invasions except during co-op, which encourages invaders to be more toxic, since there's a higher likelihood that they'll get 3v1'd.   2. The game feels way easier than previous souls games. I had a little trouble in the early game but once I got my build settled I've pretty much been steamrolling everything.   3. There's a lot of copy/paste. I don't mind the repeated enemies and minibosses so much, since there's plenty of other solid games that do similar things. My big gripe is with some of the later game mini-dungeon layouts, which overuse the trope of "ooo, this layout of rooms is exactly the same as the ones you just went through, oooo, what a labyrinth, you feel lost yet?" like bruh I though we had stopped doing that shit back in the NES era because we all agreed it wasn't fun. It's fine for like, one or two dungeons as a gimmick, but it got old fairly quick.   All that being said, the game is still an incredibly good time, and I'll certainly be seeing it through till the end.

THIS GAME SUCK S
Good game with some MAJOR flaws. What smooth-brained moron thought it was a good idea to give players a +8 weapon when the summoning depends on level and highest weapon level?  If you accidentally get gifted a high level weapon by an NPC (which happens VERY early in the game), then you won't be able to summon or be summoned by most of the population.  The game also tells you to go east after the first area, but the east is actually a mid/late area of the game, so....  Lots of the bosses get stuck on geometry.  The game suddenly gets major lag spikes in the middle of fights (not very often, but still, I'm running a high-end system and there's still lag spikes? Wtf is up with that?).  They removed homeward bones, why? Terrible design choice.  The story is meh, I loved all the souls-borne lore but this game's story isn't very captivating.  The combat, when it works right, is a lot of fun.  The graphics are pretty.  Good sound design.  So-so music (out of all the Souls Borne games, this one probably has the most forgettable soundtrack for me).  Everyone kept clamoring about how difficult this game is, but I've been plowing my way through this with little effort. I think they're just not used to the enemy delaying their attacks. It's probably one of the easier souls-borne experiences.
game is great, can't wait until the DLC drops.
If you play dark souls this is a MUST get.
seek skill
This game is a massive slog to play, boring & uninteresting especially towards the end game which has to be one of the worst things I've ever experienced in a game. Every mechanic feels like you're slogging through liquid shit, you never deal enough damage ever, enemies are exactly the same battle see this fuck huge knight? ye expect to battle him fifty times throughout the game because he's a lazily copy pasted bastard like every single thing in this fucking game. Every weapon feels the same, armor does next to nothing, enemies just get increased hitpoints & poise nothing else because fuck you baka gaijin.  The reason this garbage won GOTY is because the bar was so fucking low it didn't exist. If you must play this game buy it once it has the definitive edition with all the DLC's & patches because as it stands it isn't a complete game it's a half-ass rushed game made in less than a year like Dark Souls 3 and my goodness it shows but it's even more ridiculous appealing to people who if you invited to your house would break all your  shit for fun because they are that asinine.
Bloodborne for PC when?
fun
Game lacks guidance and a middle ground between being too linear/easy and needing XX hours to learn the moveset of a boss. I spend more time googling what to explore because you dont learn enough from your random deaths besides movesets.
I didn't think I would like it, but I like it.
Definitely good.
fun
best game
fucking awesome game
Valid.
AMAZING, Helped me through a tough time in life with countless hours of great content, will always hold a special place in my heart.
10/10 even after beating it 3 times i still want to play more
game makes me wanna taste lead and see how durable my head is against a speeding truck, cool scenery tho 20/10
This is, no doubt in my mind the best game ever made its design,story,art.battle,exploration ect. good not get better.
big sword guh energy and then I die from greed
The biggest adventure in a video game to date loads of secrets and the difficulty will drive you mad but its worth it when you finally beat it.
bro it's elden ring
great game
Is an awesome game.
It is 3 games in 1 and all are game of the year!
very versatile game! wow
Finger But Hole
try finger butthole
Have never been this excited playing a game in a long time.
Elden Ring is an incredible game. For me, It rivals Breath Of The Wild, which is my favorite open world game of all time. Its amazingly good looking, gameplay is smooth, and the difficulty is just enough. It is new player friendly in the sense that a someone who has not played a souls like before can still enjoy the game without putting a hole through their desk. The game allows the player to decide when they are ready for something and that truly makes it applicable to all types of players, even ones with skill issues. 10/10
Best game to me still
Great open world, absolute trash boss and enemy design. If you enjoyed any previous FromSoft game for their expert design of enemies and areas, DO NOT play this game. This game is clear evidence that whoever at FromSoft who designs enemies is running out of ideas and is resorting to cheap design and unfair gank fights.   Play any of the Dark Souls game before this trash.
Highly Recommend, This game is a Beautiful looking Masterpiece and its a super fun game to see the improvement in your skills while fighting multiple enemies, and boss. Having to change your strats and fighting styles to suit specific enemies make the game a good run for long term, hoping the DLC that comes out will keep the game living on.
This game fucking sucks

it good
As much of a masterpiece as everyone says it is, you just gotta give it time to settle yourfels to its pace and you' ll be on a grand journey that' ll challenge you as much as you want
I already owned the game on xbox and I loved it so much I bought it on steam to play with a 2 player mod. I had never previously played any souls games and I took a huge risk on buying Elden Ring but it payed off. It's incredibly frustrating and difficult especially for a newcomer but that is also the beauty of it. The satisfaction of beating a boss you've been stuck on for ages is unmatched. The game is beautiful and rich with content I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this game. 10/10
Good game. do buy
frrr
I git Gud :^) Holy though,what an amazing game from top to bottom.
8/10 (will change it after I experience more, for better or worse) Haven't 100% it yet, only finished the story.  All of this was done in 87 hours of play time.  My first FromSoftware game. I would say that I got my moneys worth and some more, given how much I still have left to do. Not a 10/10 simply because a few bosses were quite large, thus making close combat camera quite the challenge, making it hard to dodge (I see you Fire Giant). NPCs would just end themselves if you were to progress past a certain event/boss, not too big of a deal but a few times after I had just defeated a boss I would remember about a certain NPC and visit them to see if they got something new to say or offer, only to be greeted with an item or bell bearing. A bit discouraging but understandable. Context Im not that good at this game BUT my playthrough felt very 1 skill to win them all. Perhaps I was overleveled, although I would get rolled by bosses in 4 to 5 hits I would also roll them in 40 weapon skills or so, perhaps it was my 35 vigor's fault but again not the smartest player here.  I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE THIS LATER IMA GO SLEEP money dont grow on trees
Masterpiece
Played a bit, it's good so far.
8.7/10
100%'d the game on ps5. highly reccomend

I beat this game a few weeks ago and am already on my second play through. It was recommended to me by my older brother who played Elden Ring when it first came out. I was quite sceptical about getting the game as I knew how difficult the souls games are. It took me a while to get into the game as I had never played a souls game before and the difficulty made me think it was a poorly done game. My opinion, now I have beaten it is drastically different. This game is a true work of art, all the time and effort put into Elden Ring payed of completely. I'm not sure what game fromsofware will come out with next, but if it is as good, and as repayable as Elden Ring I am looking forward to buying it. 10/10 absolute masterpiece!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i want to shit myself
Clearly the best game of 2022. That being said, it is not perfect: PC port is standard From Software quality (that is: not great, locked 60 FPS, no DualShock/DualSense support - at least button prompts FFS! - etc.), there is a bit too much enemy/boss recycling going on, some caves/tombs are just copy/paste and not that interesting, endgame turns enemies into frustrating health sponges...  But still, what a world FromSoft managed to create! I mostly hate open-world games due to them always being full of boring filler content and boring collectibles, but From got their version of open-world formula almost exactly right.  9/10
The game that has no flaws. Completely fantastic and worth every cent.
Melina and Ranni so fine  10/10 game
very good game
play this is you like good games
Beware of dog
After a long hiatus due a hand injury, I've finally finished it and it's one of those gems that I feel like has impacted me on almost a spiritual level so I wanted to just leave a review.  It's GOTY for a reason.  That being said, expect a little bit of jankiness, but get ready for a huge world to get lost in. Lots of challenges to tackle in your own way.  Beautiful screenshot worthy vistas.  Frustrating and scary moments. Jaw dropping enemy designs. Tons of weapons, spells, armor to try out. Take the time to interact with the characters and read item descriptions to give you an idea of the shattered world your character has arrived in, there's a lot more than meets the eye.  I have a few gripes, namely that there are so many weapons and items but there is a hard limit on how many times you can re-spec your character, it limits experimentation and creativity. The item upgrading system, well, let's be real, a handful of systems are a bit convoluted too. But don't let that stop you. I recommend a blind experience but look up things when you need to because the game doesn't explain things very well, specially if you're new to souls games. Don't be afraid to try it.  The game at it's core is about perseverance. It's a souls game, it's brutal. Don't give up. Some of the bosses took me days to learn and beat, but the feeling of overcoming a challenge like that is just bliss.   Take breaks if you need to, explore different areas and try various methods to beat the bosses. Elden Ring has so many more ways to play the game than the older souls games and to make it easier on yourself if you want to by using summons or summoning help. Or you can challenge yourself and self impose your own rules. That's the beauty of it.
go hard
Listen if you like beating your head on your desk and just endless kick in the nuts this is the game for you. honestly the open world Souls game is fromsoftwares best game! i have 4 different builds and multiple play through gives you a good mix of combat, exploring, and just has an amazing story if you actually listen to the dialog with multiple side stories that explain the lore, fast travel is a nice touch with amazing boss fights.
its great i like it. its really hard

Souls-lite. But still very souls.
Positives:  Amazing Bosses Game is huge... like HUGE HUGE. Like you think you've discovered the entire map then there's like a million caves and dungeons hidden on the map with their own systems. And each one has a boss area. Then there's like an entire map under the map like wtf. Okay big game. Music is godly. Straight from when you load up the game until you end the game, music is amazing. Super pretty. Lots of builds and weapons, lots are super fun. The Lore>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Negatives:  Why are random dog mobs the hardest part of this entire game. Scarlet Chlamydia lakes :'( .  Overall: 10/10 game, would pay £300+ to be able to play it again for the first time.
SEX!!!
you die a lot oh yeah and cool comet spell go brrrrrrr
Playing this game is like injecting an insane amount of chaos and rage into your poor innocent soul and wishing that you could be doing anything more sane with your life. Pretty chill tho 10/10
Amazing
good, kill, kill kill and lore
yes
hard af
I started with me loin cloth and a stick and nothing to lose. Let's do this!
Bad game
Big sword go swoosh
pro tip: invest in your vigor stat and use consumables and talismans to increase your damage negations and the game essentially becomes trivially easy
try finger but hole
very big fun
This game is worth every penny you spend buying it I promise!
Incredible. foreskin duo literally sucks though
still need that bloodborne pc port tho
time sink
best game
No maidens?
great souls like game
so hard, so addictive
kinda fun
git gud
Couldn't have rough sex with Alexander, Blaidd or Rykard.
Hewg made me a weapon that did indeed kill a god.
Better than 2
very good game
Best game ever , would 100% recommend for souls like fans
After nearly 130 hrs of playing, and getting all achievements, I have finally concluded that this is probably the best game I have ever played. Almost every asset of this game in near perfection. I only have a few very small nit-picks that I will go through now.  - The cut scenes in this game are very cool, but it could be made a lot better with just a few small changes. like the cut scene cutting off appropriately, the scenes usually end with the screen fading to black and the music cutting out. This is not a big problem though.  - The story of these games are phenomenal, but it is very hard for a new player to understand what is happening and what their supposed to do. I don't think the game would be better if this was changed, because its kind of a trend in fromsoft games.  I'm too lazy to think of more nit-picks so just buy it if you're looking for a well rounded game that serves a challenge. 
Big hammer go BMFFFK
after playing this game for almost 100 hours i am pretty sure i am now the one who knocks
its hard but fun
amazing chest ahead
TLDR: Very fun and a breath of fresh air in the open-world genre but frustrating at times.   It's not that hard, it is but it isn't. Some bosses are way too easy, and others have had me contemplating uninstalling the game. Now, this could be chugged up to "It was a side boss" but at last no. The story bosses are inconsistently hard. Now the open world itself is great like actually phenomenal, I highly recommend exploring it to your heart's content. It's been a while since I got so caught up playing an open world. 9/10 close to perfection but there are enough oddities to drag it down ever so slightly.
very many fun very many yes would recommend It's also very fun to play modded with for example multiplayer  yes portugal
It's amazing. 10/10
oh yes, OH YES
ellen ring update: eldering pt 2 coming soon
WORTH EVERY PENNY
Everything is awesome 
solid game i enjoyed it
10/10
Pretty freakin good man
shit
sex game ever
literally helps me with my depression
Do yourself a favor and play this game...  Rise... Rise Tarnished and become The Elden Lord!!
A beautifully unfinished game. I'll buy it once GOY edition with all DLC is released and play co-op mod as it should have been.
Simply a jewel of a game.
praise the review and then try the game
It's Elden Ring, what else could i say that hasnt already been said. 10/10
Incredible
good
Best game. I would pay 100+ dollars for this game.
no room for mistakez,
cheeseburger? 
First Soulsborne game! Epic! Addicting! A bit grindy but very accommodating to new players of this genre.  Buy it! Play it!.. Just be patience and persevere!
good
ahhhh lover
This is the first Dark Souls game that I downloaded to play and I cannot believe how hard this game is. I saw that there is no in game purchases with real money and that's what got me hooked on this game because it's all skill-based.I already broke one monitor and like 3 controllers, but I am still playing it because I cannot explain how large this game is and the beauty of the game.I must admit that I used a few glitches here and there but that is only because the game is so hard.  For anyone who has anger issues, please don't buy this game it don't plate because you're going to burn your pc  down and for everybody who played this game and says that this game is easy you can go and f*** yourself.  I like this game and it's 10 out of 10.
This game is an exemple of what internet 🍆 rider can do for a game, i mean this game is just Dark Souls 4 :  - Boring world (only caelid is some what cool i guess) - Boring dungeon with trash boss who are either bosses that you already beat or normal enemies but with a bigger health bar - Same boring loop gameplay from 2009 (R1 spam, 8 frame roll, estus ingestion) - Completly inferior to all from software souls game in terms of OST, i don't remember a song except the main theme - An aboslute trash map, there's no wonder why it's the first thing they try to patch even tho the FS cult try to defend this stupidity - A goddamn PowerPoint at the start to explain the "lore" of the game like... really ?  - Reuse of assets from their older game, other game don't escape critiscim for it and ER was supposed to be a new game not another souls  - Anoying fans, you're not what you think are from thinking this game is revolutionary (it's not)    From Software is not a good video game developer, they just have a LOT of stupid fans.
Please add Breaking Bad DLC  THANKS :)
gas
almost everything of this is good from head to toe 9.9/10  my only gripe is how bad pvp [i]connection[/i] can be sometimes, sometimes it feels like im fighting someone with a wifi router from 1998 oh and pvp weapon balancing issues but theyre working on that already  everything else tho fuckin masterpiece
Blaidd is my werewolf boyfriend and now we're married. K thx bye
How am I supposed to play other game after this? Too good, too gawd damn good! 
Elden Ring is a true masterpiece and a perfect game in every sense of the word. From the stunning graphics, to the immersive story and captivating world, every aspect of this game exceeded my expectations. The level of detail and attention paid to the lore and characters is unparalleled and truly immerses the player in the world of Elden Ring. The gameplay mechanics are fluid and challenging, keeping me engaged for hours on end. The soundtrack is also a standout feature, fitting seamlessly into the game and adding to the overall experience. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves action RPGs, or just wants to experience a true work of art. Elden Ring is not just a game, it's a journey that will stay with you long after you've finished playing.
.
Made a lot of unforgettable memories solo and with a friend.
A Masterpiece
It is a beautifully crafted world. 
not my fav from soft game but i cant help but keep coming back to it, certainly a bar setter for any open world games in the future, hoping for dlc cus i want a real reason to play the game again
Just not for me, seems fun but I'm not a fan
Delicious, finally some good forking food

marikas tits this is a good game
Surely the greatest game ever, and as a 57 yo finishing this was so good. I have been playing games since the zx spectrum and there is nothing that compares to this. Amazing.
Look, there are many reasons to dislike or bounce off a Fromsoft game.  They're usually pretty drab and grey and rotting in aesthetic, they're fantastically and infamously hard to the point that a portion of the playerbase is somewhat obnoxious about it, the story tends to be vague and depressing, the controls are a little obtuse.    But I have generally always *tried* to like Fromsoft games, because they are clearly both genre defining and exceptional at what they are trying to do.  I bounced off every single one that I tried - including this one- until I picked it up again, months later, because I was drawn back by the things I had *liked* about it.    Elden Ring still has an ugly, drab, rotting aesthetic.  It is also filled with beautiful landscapes suffused with bright color and golden light, and just genuinely impressive visuals all over the place.   Elden Ring is still hard as hell.  It is also a game that allows you to level up to the point where you can easily handle bosses without having to painstakingly learn every one of their moves, while traversing literally wherever you want, wielding a wide array of toolkits and summons to address problems, and picking and choosing what encounters you think are worth your while.  Elden Rings controls are still obtuse and odd.  They work pretty well on a controller, nonetheless, and as you play you will keep finding oddities in the movesets, little things like attacks you can trigger off of dodges on certain weapons, all the while allowing you to customize and experiment with a huge array of weapons that range from abusively simple to fascinatingly complex.  Elden Rings story is still vague and depressing.  The open world aspect of it makes it fascinating to unpack, with every little piece of the environment and every new character you meet teaching you something fascinating, as well as some characters being *very* upfront with you about the story and the things that have happened.   It's also a game who's rich history was half penned by George R.R. Martin, who as usual is exploring some stuff in a way that just kinda vibes with the general Fromsoft vibe.  It all clicked this time.  So now I am into Elden Ring.  I have roamed the entirety of Lingrave and covered a huge portion of Liurnia and Caelid, I have tried four different characters and am excited about a fifth.  I've learned how to parry and I've learned how to dodge and jump and how to twohand when needed and what spec seems most powerful to me (it's claws and scholarly weapon), and I've learned that all the stats are cool but you should really put points in Vigor too.  Parts of the game seem easy now.  Other parts still have a challenge I am excited to seek.  I'm having a really good time.  I cannot emphasize this enough: it is frankly cooler to like things than to hate them.  It is absolutely more fun to meet a game where it is at and embrace what it is offering.  This game is wildly, perfectly good if you can do that.  And if you do not know how to meet a Fromsoft game where it is at, this is the best possible die roll that you will find a way to.
King fromsoft has high hopes for us, That we continue to suffer. Unto eternity
fuck you dung eater!  i want to have sex with blaidd as well 12/10.
ITS LIT AF!!!!! BUY THIS SHIT RN OR YOU ARE TROLLING
a good'un
Imagine locking your game at 60fps and 60hz, even in 2022 when this was released. LUL
Way more new player friendly than other Fromsoft titles

defiantly amazing

Ez to masterpiece 10/10 I still maidenless
good soup
I 100%'d the game and have kept playing. game very fun. best game ever, easily deserved game of the year  if invasions piss you off when you're trying to play with friends, there's a mod that seamlessly adds co-op that i don't think i should link here, but it makes co-op infinitely better, no invasions, more players, but it does make the bosses a bit tankier. okay a lot tankier, but you can also diversify your party and have dedicated dps, tank and healer. mod made 10/10 game into 11/10
So polished and stunning to look at- thank you from this is a joy
A masterpiece. Probably one of the most important games in a decade.
Great game all around. Very fun, though I'm not even finished with my first run of the game. I'm still new, but find this game very difficult and rewarding. The progression may feel confusing or slow at the start, but I suggest exploring as much as possible, as this opens up many new opportunities for growth. If not, you could simply play the game a bit more in linear fashion (simply going to Stormveil and past, which is how I originally did it), or you could watch guides on how to play the way you would like to. Any way you go about it, it is most definitely something you should play.
Yes
Greatest game I've ever played
Phenomenal
theres a lot of game in this. at least its good
I find this game over hyped,for me i find this game boring i do not see the hype in this game as others see it. i personally don't like it as there are games that are just or better like The Witcher 3 as it actually has a interesting story line is really enjoyable, making me want to play it even when the storyline has finished, not to mention better graphics from a older game. Elden ring just does not have the vibe for me.
It's peak and it's peak also it's peak it will always be peak and hmm oh right it's peak
Gayme gud
if you like taking it up the ass then this is the game for you
Getting gud in this game is a genuinely pleasurable experience.    
AMAZING GAME.100/10 GOTY and many ways to play
MUST READ! I initially tried the game and it was slow, i got very lost quickly, and it was very frustrating so refunded the game. Later a friend told me to download it again and try with his help. After trying again with his guidance and explanation of the game, I've found this game is AWESOME. Definitely a game you will watch youtube videos and guides on but well worth it. Only thing I wish they would add is a CO-OP mode so i can run the game with a friend in-game. Overall awesome though! (PS: I'm a casual gamer who plays a couple hours a night)
As someone whom has played all the darksouls games and demons souls back in the day i can say that this is a great game however a large portion of the game and bosses are pure tedium and often i felt like it wasnt fun and that overshadows quite a bit of the good parts of the game.
yee
The game has an interesting story, graphics and gameplay, but the fights are fucking ridiculous. As a Dark Souls veteran I thought we were passed this fast paced Sekiro shit. I hit them twice if I'm lucky then get my shield ripped away with one stab and kicked by the back of the horse. Fucking ridiculous difficulty.
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

Pretty good.

this game is really fun
Step 1: Try fingers Step 2: but hole
Everything good, except Torrent, Kill that stupid horse.
the most game ever
Very fun with good story, but brutally hard
The. Best. Game. EVER. Made.  I have never played a better video game. Perfect combat, perfect music, perfect map, design is perfect. Everything is near perfect or perfect. The only bad part of this entire game experience is sometimes the combat is clunky and 2 of the enemies are unbearable.  10/10, Almost perfection!!!
it's a good game for people who plays NES games
truly incredible experience that will have me playing for years, i hope to play it with my children one day. I would encourage any new players to take their time with this game, to be curious, and to embrace the challenge. If you're new and you've hit the figurative wall when fighting a boss or progressing an area, my suggestion would be to explore other areas and grow your strength, then return after some time. If you plan to thoroughly complete this huge game, a first run make take 100+ hours to beat so take your time and enjoy the ride to avoid burn out. I would also suggest playing online, the community for this game is incredible and summoning players to your world gives it alot of life. good luck.
made me smash keyboard 10/10 
It is an excellent fast paced RPG with a decent multiplayer. It has great graphics and wonderful story line. Rivals the imagination of many a DnD DMs all for the flower of a maiden! Get you some of this Elden Ring in yo life!
best game ive ever played in my life
100 hours into the game, and I still can't beat the shit out of this game, yeah it's absolutely a recommended game for you who want to destroy your sanity
truly one of the games of all time
THIS IS GOOD IF U DONT HAVE A LIFE 
very bad game
I like trees, super cool tree (is golden)
never screamed more in my life than while playing this game , 10/10 would play again
great game 
Very fun, has good dogs and bad. 10/10
dog
its a great game, hard but fair
haven't finished yet, but so far i like it. some concepts, such as attribute scaling and having three separate stats just for magic usage, are a bit confusing after conquering something like BotW. not to mention the skill gap is tremendously large. but if you're like me and struggle with games like this, just try to explore the entirety of limgrave and look up helpful tips for beginners before attempting margit, as that boss basically determines if you are able to handle the rest of the game. will update once i finish the game👍
fuck ya baby shits amazing
well it won game of the year
It's an excellent iteration on Dark Souls formula in open world setting and mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. If you're a first timer, this is a great place to start as Elden Ring offers a plethora of playstyles, weapons, summons and even mounted combat to tackle the games steep challenges. It's not quite Froms best work to date, but no one can deny the ambition and scope of the game and that alone is worth the praise it gets, for the most part.
im just ass tbh
  What can I say, this game RULEZ!!
Fun
e
good
behold Elden Ring!
no ring

It's fantastic in so many ways

best soulslike game
ds3 was better
10/10
Although the journey may be very tedious it is also very enjoyable and a good way to release anger, have fun, make memories and get an acheivement.
Buenardo
I am eleder ring :)
im tired. i beat all achievements, finally, but my god am i tired. This is a good game, but really hard, as expected from souls likes, so uhhh 10/10 would get grabbed by the elden lord and shoved into the ground like a seed into the earth again.
SCORE: 8/10  Elden Ring initially gripped me in a way few other games have. The starting area of Limgrave is superbly designed, offering a significant amount of enemy variety, enticing landscapes and plenty to explore. The sense of awe and wonder is strong, perhaps unrivalled among open world games.  The areas that immediately follow it maintain a high level of quality, even if not quite high as the opening area. The repetition of the caves, catacombs, etc. was starting to wear a little thin, the amount of reused bosses was becoming more noticeable and my frustration at how little of the loot I was finding was relevant to my build was growing, but the first fifty hours or so were nevertheless extremely engaging.  Unfortunately, there is a point in the game at which those minor flaws start to become major ones. The enemy variety is extremely front-loaded, leading to dozens of hours of playtime in the latter half of the game fighting almost nothing but reused enemies. Exploration became unrewarding when it began to dawn on me just how few of the things I was finding I even considered using. The repetitive open world filler content had long worn out its welcome.  The more I played, the more I began to think this is not some new, innovative approach to open world design as many people claim. If, for example, clearing out an enemy camp in an Assassin's Creed game is considered a bad example of content to put in an open world, I don't see how clearing out a copy-paste catacomb, fighting a boss I've seen several times before at the end of it and opening a chest to get a weapon I'll never use is much of an improvement. The presentation of this content, choosing not to mark it on the map beforehand and put a check mark next to it when you're done, is welcome. But the standard of the actual content itself once you find it is not any better than what other open world games have to offer.  As with many other open world games, I think Elden Ring would be better if it showed more restraint. There is simply just not enough interesting content to fill its huge world. It's a game with many memorable moments, but almost all of those came in the first half of the ninety-five hours I spent playing it.
fun and hard
The Best Game I have ever played.
69 hours nice
It's Elden Ring. What else do you need to know at this point?
Really don't understand why is this game so special? Story is, well not existing. Gameplay is repetitive. And you can simply not enjoy the game. It's all about finding some patterns among the bosses and exploit that...
If it had a seamless or permanent multiplayer function implemented, this would be the perfect game. 9.5/10
goes hard

fun
Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the genre. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time. From my initial foray into the world to the final moments, every step of the journey is a note in a personalized epic that kept me coming back for more. The Lands Between is a world full of discovery, and while a clear path forward exists for those seeking guidance, roaming the lands unfettered without a particular goal in mind often yields surprises. I often had a spot to explore marked on my map and got off-track along the way, sometimes leading to entirely new areas and feature-dense zones. The grandiose world is chock full of characters, quests, and various dungeon crawls ranging from tiny catacombs to massive multilayered tombs. While the journey starts with little caves, mines, and other dungeon delves, these experiences become more complex. Two-room affairs eventually become intricate teleport puzzles or scenarios where you discover unusual ways to interact with the environment, like learning to use traps for traversal or sniffing out secret walls. Your character is incredibly customizable, which I found highly rewarding. You can attach various skills and scaling mechanics across the board, allowing you to truly create your own vision of a traveling hero. Respecialization and alterations allow you to finely tweak your creation without worrying too much about experimentation along the way as you arm yourself with everything from explosive pots to potent perfumes to complement your ever-growing arsenal. The open world is majestic, dripping with flavor and atmosphere, and full of fabulous finds. However, the legacy dungeons are the stuff of legend, often connecting to the outside from multiple points. These curated sprawls are a dream to dissect, and Elden Ring often offers different ways to maneuver through these areas. The big bosses, generally found at the end of legacy dungeons, feel like wonderful wars against demigods. These brilliant set piece battles are thrilling exclamation points to an outrageous odyssey, absolute spectacles, and masterful combinations of tension and triumph. Elden Ring has the distinction of having the best and most challenging boss battle in any From Software game to date. Hidden away and optional, this encounter had me waking up in the middle of the night to come back and crash against its beautiful and terrifying destruction over and over again. After finally besting this opponent, I let loose a triumphant victory roar there while sitting in the dark and wearing my pajamas, wanting nothing more than to experience the encounter again. This example speaks to how unbelievably compelling and immersive Elden Ring is; I regularly put it down with the intent of doing something else and found myself back within minutes. There is always one more gnawing mystery to unravel, one more boss to beat, and one more hidden route to find.  Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.
I like this game , its chilling game and Hard game at the same time. I believe you will like it.
The
add sex
Make a favor for you. Play it
amazing quality game
got called bitchless
No Ultra Wide Support?  It will let you select 3440x1440 full screen it but it sure as heck isnt supported because it just crops my game down to a 16:9
Truly a masterpiece FROM SOFTWARE
Excellent game play, story and replay ability. Beautiful world graphics. the character creation alone could have you spending hours making the "just right" character. A must play for any RPG fan.
very good
did the entire ranni questline and it didnt let me fuck her, terrible game DO NOT RECCOMEND
Spicy, but good
I LOVE THIS GAME! The  reason its so good is because its easy to learn amazing to explore and because its hard it takes you a while to beat you have to learn patterns and there is a lot of reputability.
bestgame
Look, I could write an entire essay about this game here, but I don't wanna waste neither your or my time, so here's the short of it: the art direction and the level design are amazing, you'll have a hard time convincing me any other developer has an art direction team on par with From Soft, they're just the best in the industry. The exploration is absolutely amazing. The bosses are bad. They're visually impressive, often being great spectacles to behold with all their spells and effects, but when it comes to the gameplay itself they're nothing more than cheap. Remember "tough but fair"? That's gone. Bosses always have lots of huge AoE homing attacks they can spam infinitely, zero down time between attacks, are specially designed with a "gotcha" mentality, with attacks specially engineered to catch you not matter what, and all of them have a correct way of being fought here; you either play by the "meta" or you're in for a bad time. Like to experiment with different builds and items? Look elsehere, there's no room for it here. I didn't play by the meta 'cause I didn't know what it was until after I finished the game; wanna know how I got through them? Over levelling and brute forcing. They're frustrating even in victory.  That's it, great game, bad bosses. That's the short of it.
I punched my monitor in the subterenean shunning ground and had to buy a new one 10/10 thank you elden ring for making me rage and need to buy a new one.
OHHH ELDEN RİNG
The greatest steam game ever!
crappiest souls game after ds2
Pretty casual gameplay. Last few bosses are a bit to easy like, Malenia. Overall fun platforming and forgiving combat system. 10/10 would recommend for first time gamers.
eh, it was alright. 6/10.

Amazing
TL;DR: Decent game, but nothing groundbreaking or innovative in Soulsformula nor in Openworld games really to warrant  goty.  Just to make clear, I do like and enjoy FromSoftware's works. So all respect for Miyazaki and his team. And I like the game, even though to me it is more or less just Dark Souls 4.  Will most likely still play more and finish ER at somepoint.  But since there is no "Mixed" review I'll give a thumbs down.  If you liked previous soulsgames and are fan of the genre, then most likely you'll find something to enjoy from here too. If you are new to soulslikes, then this might not be your cup of tea.  (To add that I wasn't really on the hype train waiting for ER, was more less "might as well buy for shits and giggles" and for me it has paid itself back.)  FS has proven time and time again that they can make great worlds with interesting areas, but on Elden Ring, I personally feel that some of the magic was lost due to the shift of open world. I think that From is more strong when building interconnected labyrinths like the ones in Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1 to compare. In ER they've managed to do this the Legacy set pieces very nicely. They are straight up comparable to previous works of FS.  The world is pretty, but pretty alone doesn't make it good. Even with all the vistas and PoI's the world at times feels empty and recycled (Though recycling in ER is a problem in itself at times) and after a while you won't be spending that much time on the map itself anymore since fast travel makes travelling on Torrent obsolete.  I think that ER provides a fair challenge when compared to other soulsborne games, the difficulty is on par and the option of being able to do something else when facing a wall is a nice addition even though you've always had the ability to go back and grind (if one chooses so) unless you wanted to throw yourself against that wall till it breaks.
Incredible game, every thing about this game is perfect. The story, the lore, the world, the soundtrack, every picturesque location, and every jaw dropping boss fight is so perfectly crafted. Don't let the difficulty dissuade you from experiencing this game. One of the greatest of all time
masterpiece
Insatiable game Welcome to addiction
Kind of a hidden gem ngl
this game is amazing , i cant stop coming back to play it , definitely deserved GOTY
It seems impossible if you go into this game completely blind, as i did. I played 4 hours and got so infuriated that I uninstalled the game. Fast forward several months later and stumbled upon a guide for beginners on youtube. Followed it to a T and son a bitch, I can FINALLY play the game!   Really, you need a guide to get started in this game. For those who obviously played without one, I salute you, but I am a more casual gamer and hate cryptic shit. I need to know where to go and what to do, cuz I ain't gonna figure it out myself. So, if you're having trouble getting into this game, watch a guide on youtube on how to start off correctly. After that, the game is VERY enjoyable. Of course it can be hard, but there's ways to make it MUCH more bearable and fun. Def reccommend!
I've never thought I would miss Dark Souls 2.
death
If you are looking for a world full of fun, risk-taking adventures that gets your blood pumping no matter your skill level, this is the game you NEED. This game has its moments of action filled quests and mind boggling moments where you're just like, "the developers are absolute geniuses for making it this way..." Just an amazing game overall. I do not normally write feedback like this, ever, but this game deserves this positive feedback. Well done!
I absolutely love this game, despite all the swearing I do sometimes lol. The gameplay to me is solid along with the map and boss designs. I will say there is sooo much to do that you can literally hop on and roam around because you will never know what you will find. I am not the greatest at FromSoftware Games however my journey unbeknownst to me began with Demon Souls back on PS3. Never beat it. Afterwards I was reintroduced with Bloodborne, then Dark Souls III and finally Dark Souls II. Try it out, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.
GOTY without any questions asked. I've never properly invested time into any souls games before but Elden Ring is very much approachable by someone with 0 experience with souls games
I have been playing FROM Software games since DS1 came out on the 360. I have tried to like these games over and over. I have played DS1 from many different angles and many different classes, but have never seen the appeal. To me, playing these games just feels like training yourself to be really good at executing a half-baked feedback loop process with extremely broken tools, and Elden Ring is no exception. Not only does this game exemplify everything wrong with the design of FROM games, but it doesn't even do it in an original or groundbreaking way like lots of people would have you believe. The combat is almost exactly like DS1, and the bosses are an odd hybrid of styles and presentation from Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. The open world is lifeless and dull, and the game dumps needlessly obtuse exposition with no explanation of other parts of the lore or why you as the player should care. It's just "go on a great quest, oh chosen Undead!" Yeah, I haven't seen that anywhere else... except it's the premise for every FROM game since Dark Souls. Truly I am absolutely baffled as to how this game won any awards, much less Game of the Year. If you want a video game that you can install, have fun with, and put down until you wanna play again, this is NOT the game for you. If you like games where you have to sink an extreme amount of time and research into the world's lore, the broken combat system, and the general obtuse and bloated design of the game in hopes that you MIGHT be capable of squeezing out even the smallest crumbs of fun from it, then be my guest here. Hopefully I can at least get a refund so I can say I spent my money on a game I will actually play instead of a game that I boot up, play for 5 minutes, be reminded why I didn't buy at launch, die due to broken hit detection, and turn off again for 3 or 4 more weeks. Maybe I'm old school, but I think video games should be fun right out of the box. Part of the reason I love PC gaming specifically is because there is so much variety to be had in terms of game experiences, whether in terms of "pick up and play" or "big time sink" type games like this one. And that is definitely not to say that all games that require you to put time and research into them are bad; some of my favorite games are Stalker, Silent Hill, and Disco Elysium, all games that require you to retain and put effort into the world and just being in the game. But this game, to me, epitomizes the soulless AAA product machine that gaming has become. "Explore the open world!" Why? Is there anything worth seeing there? Is there a good story? Or does everything in this game ultimately serve as just fluff in between hours of grinding that you're expected to just enjoy without any clear motivation as to why you should be enjoying it? And even then, when the story DOES show up, it's the exact same pseudo-verbose fake Tolkien crap FROM has been spoon-feeding their blood-loyal fans since Dark Souls.  Seriously, if you want to waste your time "getting gud" at a broken ass game, at least do it with Bloodborne. You'd be doing yourself a service to save up the money to buy a PS4 just to buy Bloodborne over playing this one. I'm probably SOL on getting a refund, so if you see I have higher hours now than when I wrote this review, it is because I am simply trying to complete the game to get my money's worth and uninstall it so I can go back to playing something else.
The absolute sense of wonder from exploring such a massively detailed world and being able to discover so much unique content completely organically is liberating and breathes a breath of fresh air into the open-world genre. Pair that with refined Souls-like combat, build variety, replayability, story-telling, and lore and you easily have one of the best games of the year if not of this generation.
good but elden bling better
This game just isn’t made for me but If you're a soul-gamer fanboy or a masochist, this game is juuuuust for you;  This game hide behind "show don’t tell" / "open-world" / "Soul game" as an excuse for poor storytelling and no personality. Overall the game is tedious, boring and random, with brief conversations and minimal NPC interaction (even when you confront important characters), just kill everything and get the loot... because everything wants to kill you... because.  Quests are all over the place with no way of tracking and by the time you find another NPC or a hint you don't even remember what you were working towards and you don't care. you can fight a boss or jump through hoops to complete an area just to get an item that is useless. main items are hidden away in places you overlooked with no good reason and no way of you knowing that.  On the bright side... the game is visually beautiful and the models and combat mechanics are amazing.
I will rate it 8/10 (more on this below)  This game is purely designed for a true rpg experience i.e there would be no guidance or linear lore progression. You can go anywhere you wish but you will have to figure things on your own. To some people its exactly what they want, and for some it would be a terrible experience.  Things you will experience: - 1) Beautiful Landscapes 2) Sense of true exploration 3) Frustration (because the game is designed to be hard and is unforgiving, but you will get used to it). 4) Epic feeling/sense of accomplishment once you beat a certain boss. 5) Little to no happiness, dark world.  Things elden ring need to have for me to give it 10/10  1) Easy mode - It enables casual gamers to have a lore experience and not grind for an hour to learn boss patterns to beat them, it might be something a souls fan would love but a casual gamer is not looking to experience that. They just want to experience the art of the game and lore.  2) Game mechanics/rules need to be fair for everyone in the game - For eg In elden ring you cannot cancel your animation, but some bosses do not respect it. (Malenia) and every spell should have some cooldown to it to prevent npc from constantly spamming it due to error in programming.  3) A guide (Yes a guide) - As mentioned in point 1, the majority of gamers play games casually. So a guide system would be helpful (something like questhelper from World of Warcraft). It can try to guide a player for a more linear progression.  4) Option to re-fight a boss - Personally when I finished the game, I wanted to fight certain bosses because those were fun. But unfortunately you cannot and the only option is the new game+, I don't feel like doing the same again just to fight bosses. Especially when I have already finished 100% of the game. There is no incentive in doing so when you have already explored the whole game.  5) True coop: I don't know how can such a beautiful game have such a bad co-op experience, it has been solved upto some extend by modding community when they created "Seamless co-op". But true co-op in elden ring would have made it 100x better in my opinion.  Overall, the game is gonna give you a great experience. Go for it! :)
If you hate yourself then play then game   But for real tho it's a great game but very hard
Terrible end game
It's Elden Ring. It's a great but challenging game with an amazing atmosphere and lore. An inspiring masterpiece.
10/10
Good game
Great game, if you like dark souls youll love this game
remove delay on malenia and elden beast entirely. else good
Save your energy! This game enables its users to self-flagellate in the comforts of their own homes! 10/10 Can't recommend enough!
would be 10/10 if not some crashes.
great game
Behold Ring! Therefore, seek dog
Love the game! The graphics are amazing, game content is excellent and challenging!  BUT.... the messages are so lame and are everywhere!  Please include the ability to turn messages off so players can  enjoy the game itself!
I got all achievements on the xbox version and I couldn't get enough so...here I am. 11 hours in doing yet a different build and still having fun.
Not my style but game is great!
Putrid erdtree avatar can kiss these

if their is ever a game worth 60 dollars its elden ring
Realy cool game about collecting old finger jewellery, with a few enemies in between I guess
dudes rock
What bad can you say about game with [b]Soldier of God, Rick[/b] in it. I'd give this game GOTY just for this boss fight alone. Masterpiece
It's a great RPG. :)
One of the games of all time
One of the best games ever
Masterpiece.
Probably the best game ever made
ds2 is better
It is a good game until you meet a bear that is harder to beat than a demigod

yes. just do it

GOTY
L game
Easily GOTY without question. I have already got platinum on my PS5, but wanted to also have it on steam and play with more friends that already have it.  By far the best Fromsoftware experience with lots of content and exploration.  Highly recommend it for any new players that are looking to get into souls-like games. This game has a lot of quality of life improvements over the previous titles and does not have the "walk of shame" to the boss, which was previously present in the early titles of Fromsoft and was one of the main factors contributing to players giving up.
the reason why i didnt go to school
After getting all Achievements I can now die a happy death
Best game after Skyrim

The most accessible Souls game. Well deserving of all the accolades it received.

save corrupted, lost my 130 hours save right before [spoiler] ashen capital [/spoiler]  As much as i like it, i wont be touching the game ever again. if you end up buying it remember to back up your files frequently.
This is legit the BIGGEST open world game I have ever played in my life. The sheer detailing of every region be it the art direction , enemy variety , level design , ambience & music is pure exquisite craftmanship  from the developers. Despite the open world design & approach borrowing it's idea from ZELDA , Elden Ring absolutely takes it to another level making it an experience unlike any other game I have played. The game is bigger than anybody can fathom. At times it could be quite overwhelming to keep track of the regions you have discovered, the NPC interactions and the constant breaking of questlines but it's quite unique on how the game doesn't dump details at your face and rather rewards you for exploration and discovery with it's rich and mysterious lore. I also think this is by far the most accessible FROM SOFTWARE game mainly because of the amount of choices you are left with to approach the game. The game play and combat though is detailed & vast doesn't necessarily have the learning curve complexity of their PREVIOUS game SEKIRO. Some of the biggest issues I had with the game are the poor optimisation for PC performance despite a locked 60 fps even in my 3060 GPU. Most of the Dragon battles I faced had extreme stuttering in terms of performance. Also there are some questionable design choices in the UI , for instance every time the game has a popup window in the middle of a battle when I resummon Torrent after he is dead. I get the need of it in the initial stages of the game but why does it continue till the very end. It's very much distracting and can quite lead you to your death at times. At least they should have included an option to turn it off in the settings. Also for a game with it's absolutely incredible number of bosses , the biggest enemy you will ever face is going to be the CAMERA. As the POPULAR saying goes : " YOU CAN ESCAPE THE BOSSES , BUT NEVER THE CAMERA "    9/10 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Played through and beat this on my friend's account. Got it for my account even though I didn't plan on playing again just to support. I just started to play again. Great.
Fricken great
cool
one of the best games in the genre and all time easily
fun
Great game, so much to do. Quite difficult initially and hard to follow quest lines as there isn't a quest log or anything, you just have to remember a lot. Saying that though, the gameplay is great.
this game is worth every cent. my only issue is the non communication for any Real DLC that they are going to release with a box price on that DLC. While i do enjoy Free DLC its all kind of tiny in comparison to what a 20 dollar DLC would bring to the table and the game.
addictive
Perfect game. I was doubtful on buying since I didn't want to get stuck on a boss or get mad and quit, since in turn it would've been wasted money. This game is a masterpiece that I am so delighted to be able to enjoy. If you're thinking of buying this, please do, you'll enjoy every moment of it; Either it be the beautiful landscape and open world design or the intense, enjoyable bossfights.
Strong recommendation especially if you like dying in epic circumstances.
Fromsoft at its best. Truly a game to get lost in if you're an adventure RPG fan. No hand holding but, not impossible to play.
O DEATH. BECOME MY BLADE ONCE AGAIN.
One of the best games you'll ever play.

前有疯婆娘玛丽卡乱砸法环，后有熊孩子米凯拉被人绑架，我就想问问米凯拉，你能不能管好你姐妹，让她别随便乱砍人
Great game! It will challenge your patience, but if you are willing to get better at a thing, Elden Ring is your game! I couldn't tell you how awesome I felt once I felled Margit after he whopped my butt 50ish times. (no im no exaggerating) The game play is what a game should be, challenging yet gratifying upon wins! And without any form of pay store or otherwise!  You play the game, you have fun! Thanks for reading. I definitely recommend buying!
Going to be hard for Fromsoftware to top this one. only critique is how coop isn't more fluid and continuous. but that's how all souls games are.

why is it always mushroom?
drop the DLC already you bastards  EDIT: yeah ok im satisfied with the single image you gave us carry on
30 hours or so in: I was on the fence for a while but I'm very glad I bought this game.  Challenging and satisfying with a dark yet beautiful world to explore!  You won't be disappointed! ------------ Edit after 300 hours:  I am The Lord of Frenzied Flame.  Elden Ring is the only game I have 100% completion on. This game is amazing. Wish I could experience it for the first time again.  (I don't count Ready or Not as it has currently 1 achievement and it's obtained during tutorial.)
Greatest RPG of all time imo!
This is my second ever soulsborne game(Sekiro was the first) that Ive actually made a lot of progress in. The open world is amazing and Ive spent tonnes of hours just running around exploring and fighting mini bosses without even progressing in the story. Loads of weapons and spells to choose from till you find what fits your playstyle best. Would definitely recommend.
I die a lot but I still come back. :-/   Great on steam deck
Dark Souls but Game of Thrones
amazing
Good game.
good
try finger but hole
Good and Hard.
"multiplayer" basically false advertising with this shit ass shit fix the online part of the game and would be 20/10
What an amazing game. While there are certainly some flaws, the experience of playing this game, be it your first ever playthrough of a FromSoft title or your 100th, is truly unmatched. I found the difficulty to be perfect. The exploration was consistently amazing, and everything felt like it had its own proper place. The world is unbelievably well crafted, and no two journeys are ever exactly alike. I have beaten this game god knows how many times, and each and every time I have found something new to appreciate and be amazed by this amazing creation. If you are able to buy and play this game, the decision is unquestionable. Be ready for an experience like no other.
fun game
it good
First time ever playing a game like this. Started a little rough and was a little confused. Now can't stop playing this game. Hope they come out with DLC soon.
Best
GOOD
What could I say about this perfect game that has not already been said
Great game, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
Could this be a weak foe?

This game is hard...AND SO AM I!
sword go brrrr
One of the best games i have ever played! which makes me start to REGRET not playing all the souls games.
I love this game
Great!
Boy oh boy, this game is nothing less than great. Not only is this game cinematic the combat is fun the difficulty although at times can be a bit unfair is rather enjoyable, Being my first souls game I enjoy the experience a lot. Given that the game is cinematic which already makes an open-world game fun to explore, the music and looks tell you everything about the area. An example of this would be both the Leyndell Sewers and Caelid both of those areas feel uninviting as if you aren't supposed to be there. To be honest you probably aren't wanted there of the things that lurk in those places but that's what I love about the game the music, and the view all tell the same story of what's going on it, The game crafts and blends it all together beautifully. For the most part, all the bosses are fun, there are a couple of mini-bosses I dislike a lot and someone of them even required me to do some of those annoying ones for the completion of some character storylines, ( and a couple of boss fights that are required for the main story to progress that is horrible if you aren't prepared ). The game feels very rewarding for going out of your way to find things, and fighting the boss fights makes me feel like a badass when I finally manage to win. The story in Elden Ring also was amazing, a lot of people may say Elden Ring has no story, but that isn't the case it just has a different variation of storytelling. Such as Frenzy Flame (which the story starts at the very beginning of the game) or the story about the Lord of Blood (which is also something you'll likely run into). These little aspects affect the entire story and the more you learn about it the greater the connection grows with characters and the more it will hurt when some of said characters die. Elden Ring is truly a great game, regardless you mean the lore of a boss that you fought previously or a battle that you prepared for hours in advance. I personally felt a drive to win against those bosses as I imagined a world where they won and they succeeded. I would say this game is worth buying even at full price, but I wouldn't blame you for waiting for a sale.
Git gud
Brutal yet rewarding
ts makes my pp bingle
good
very cool
goty
pain. hurt even. agony if you feel so inclined
From the Developers of Dark Souls. More Dark Souls. No disappointment.  Anyway, head into Dark Souls 3 before Elden Ring. Make your own opinion on this game. Don't read reviews that nitpick stuff (and turns you sad) off the game you wanna try out. [u]Don't spoil it for yourself[/u]. All Dark Souls have their own strengths as devs try out different approaches.
Good game if u like souls 3
i hate it
peak gotta be best soul game fr dark souls 3 is nothing compared to this I love this game it is life. I just wanna have a good night.
Do yourself a favor and buckle in for the full ride. At least once.

Fun to play with a friend 
yes
This game is like if Castlevania 2 for the NES had a secret lovechild with Skyrim. How could you not recommend it? Game of the year, maybe of the decade.
I don't review games, but this is a masterpiece.
Berserk, but if it was JRPG. Best Game Ever..
fun
There is a reason this game won GOTY.  From software delivers a masterpiece of a game that does wonders for open-world game design while still maintaining it's identity as a from software souls-like game. The music, the visuals and the gameplay is all on point with a excellent atmosphere and setting that is rather absorbing.   The only weak point about this game is the PC port's performance (mostly). It's gotten a lot better than on launch but it's still choppy at one or two moments (and i have a really nice rig too).
im so bad at this game but i still like very much, much wow, very hard, great thing.
I killed a dog with a knife then proceeded to kill 3 demigods
ehh na
It has a jump button
bad
it won game of the year you should play it but it can be frustrating for some if not most players but its a very rewarding game to play
milk
Amazing game
I cried.
Stakes of marika.
IT good trust me Im not a  bot
I can't stop. So frustratingly hard at times in such a good way.
I still haven't beaten this game :(
Great  game
Try and fail to kill the same boss 100 times without changing my strategy at all. 10/10
Hands down, undoubtedly the game of the year. The sheer scope and grandeur of the game, along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched - among the very best that games have to offer.  It plays as a truly great game for the first 2/3rds of a typical playthrough. After which, I am dumbfounded by how sharp the drop-off is. How can a game provide 40 hours of near-perfect experience, and be tarnished by 20 hours of uninspired and truly baffling decisions at the end? From poor use of repeated content, and poor late-game balancing, to truly boring and at times truly unfair late-game bosses. It's frustrating how sullied my experience is with the game because of how padded and unnecessary certain sections and bosses during the late game were. (Youtube video essays such as Joseph Anderson, VG Matthew, and NeverKnowsBest's do a great job detailing these more than any review you will see here)  This game is well worth playing, it's an experience that almost universally - is agreed upon as near perfect at least until the late game. However, the joy of finishing the game is simply not there for me. I didn't feel that sense of triumph in overcoming adversity and culminating in a fitting end to the story - instead, I am simply glad that it is over.  Along with BoTW, this has shown me what a truly great game is like - at least in some aspects. I am glad that this game has inspired me to get into playing more singleplayer games where competitiveness is not the be-all and end-all. 10/10
Best game i've ever played. masterpiece. Completed 3 times on PS5 before buying here.
really hard but a great challenge

i hate rpgs/open world games and this game is now one of my favorites
First souls game. Definitely recommend if you are getting into the series or enjoy open world games. Difficult for the first couple of hours but addicting once you are balls deep. Game is more forgiving than other souls-like games and is a blast to experience for the first time. 9/10. *chef's kiss*
Very good. 10/10.
very fun to play with my friends and joke around
very good game, i would say i had conquered the first 10 hrs of elden ring with ez (not lying)

One of the best games I have ever played, a masterful spiritual sequel to Dark Souls.
Its fun. Its nothing like Terraria.

I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's beautiful and unique. First souls game I plan on finishing. Slowly though, I plan on enjoying this one.   As for the bad, I do get seemingly random frame drops in groups of three, always. They don't happen often though. During them, my gpu utilization drops as well. Happens to me on every graphics settings. Consistent frames at my capped rate of 130 other than that. (lowering grass from max to high makes gave me 10-20 fps).   There also seems to be some kb/mouse input problems with attacks not registering, etc. Probably has to do with it being made for controllers and might even be because of the higher framerates. Either way, for me, these problems definitely don't stop me from playing and the comfort of kb/m keep me from going controller. It is what it is.   12700K, 3060ti. Community CAN be toxic but not everyone is. I can endorse the fextralife wiki and videos for help on concepts and stuff.   Never have I liked a game that frustrates me this much. Yes, I feel I am doomed to forever be a souls noob, but I'm still gonna beat this shit.
I fell in love before i even beat the first big boss
Better than Breath of the Wild. 0_0
One of the best soul-like game.  Graphics 10/10 Plot 10/10 Mechanics 10/10 Jump 11/10
Elden Ring might be the best game that FromSoftware have released so far after Bloodborne (I'm a big fan of Dark Souls Series too). This game is so well done, it looks like a playable painting masterpiece. The art direction, the gameplay, the world, the NPC's, bosses, music, the story behind all of it, there's so many things that I cold point here because everything is so beautiful! It's an open world game that really feels like a open world because there's life on it, it's not empty and it catches your attention all the time. Highly recommend Elden Ring for people that likes a good challenge, people that admires art in all shapes, also for the ones that loves to dig to discover more and more about the lore around the game story. My tips: DON'T RUSH, explore, READ everything, take your time, have fun and KEEP TRYING! Easy 10/10. Also very well deserved GOTY award.
cool and good
Great Game starts out hard but when you learn its Awesome if you cant control your self YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!

Twas Good
an amasing game, i am truly in love with it, super free to do whatever you want
Pot man :)
masterpiece!
yes
I've had an off on again relationship with fromsoft games. I absolutely loved Dark Souls in 2011 and i have played nearly all there titles. The problem is my tolerance for these sorts of games seemed to have diminished over the years as life can be stressful as it is without enduring that stress through my favourite pastime (Gaming) BUT here's the thing that elevates Elden RIng to be my favourite Fromsoft game....this is finally accessible to all levels of gamer.  The game is accessible for a variety of reasons, the Open World allows you too play at your own pace levelling up as you do but the main reason (and it really is a game changer) is there is now summoning posts outside every boss fight and most locations. This means you can obtain help from another player if (Much more likely when) you get stuck. This is a genius move that now enables this to be enjoyed by everyone rather then the hardcore end of the market.  The game isn't perfect, You can't pause the game which can be a real headache, the camera angle can be a pain and your steed's jumping (Seems to be a slight button delay) can cause a bit of frustration but the word frustrating isn't what i would describe this game which is a first for me when referring to fromsoft games. The vast open world with its unique, varied and vast locations truly outweigh any small negatives anyway This also contains some of the best character design in any media!  If you've delayed playing this due to past experiences with fromsoft then you owe yourself to try this. I would safely assume that you won't be disappointed.
brrr
Before Elden Ring, I had never played a From game before. But I was intrigued by all Elden Ring’s 10/10 ratings and the comparisons to Breath of the Wild, one of my favorite games.  This is a review for people like me, who are intimidated by the reputation for difficulty but are still willing to consider it because of all those stellar ratings.  OVERVIEW  The plot, such as it is, is Lord of the Rings, except you want to seize the One Ring for yourself so you can conquer Middle-EarthTheLands Between. In typical video game fashion, the ring has been split into multiple pieces and you have to find and murder the owners of each piece.  From a gameplay perspective, this means you explore ruins and dungeons, kill enemies, get better equipment and magic, level up, and repeat many times. There’s no other plot to speak of. NPC’s exist, but they mostly spout obscure and unintelligible gibberish.  Developer From Software is infamous for offering only Hard Mode with no lower difficulty or accessibility options, and they did the same here. If you like to play on Story Mode, find Normal Mode in other games very challenging, or need accessibility settings beyond controller remapping, From Software doesn’t want your business and you can stop reading now.  THE INTRO  This is not a noob-friendly game, starting with character creation. You start with a class selector, with eight different class options. Each class has a bunch of numbers and symbols, but there’s no explanation of what any of those symbols mean or what abilities that class has.   Then you pick a starting “boon”, from about fifteen options. What does this do? Is it important? Also no explanation.  The combat tutorial is a brazen “fuck you” to noobs, because they stick it off the side where you can easily just walk right past it, and even when you go through it it barely explains how any of the systems work.  After the tutorial, same story. As you gain power, you pick stats to level up and pick weapons and equipment. When you do this, Elden Ring’s developers give you a stats screen full of tiny, barely-legible numbers.  Fortunately, my husband is a Dark Souls fan who had already played the game. He helped me pick a class, pointed out the tutorial that I wandered past, explained how blocking works, pointed out more stuff when it was clear I didn’t understand some system, and gave me pointers on how to pick stats to level up.  Having someone to help was absolutely essential. Without my husband’s advice, I would have given up in frustration within the first two hours.  THE GOOD PARTS. THEY’RE REALLY GOOD  Once past that initial hurdle, things got a lot better.  The world design is S-tier. You walk (or ride) around, and look at the environment, and you can be sure that no matter which direction you go you will find something. Quest markers and checklists are nonexistent. Points of interest are common and clearly telegraphed, while the path to get there is not always obvious, so you have to look around and figure out what to do.  No matter what the point of interest is, what you find there will almost always be combat.  Combat being the only objective sounds like it would be repetitive, but it isn’t.  By varying the size and shape of battle arenas and the types of enemy groupings, Elden Ring makes encounters become completely different even when facing enemies you’ve seen many times before.  Elden Ring keeps this variety up for the whole game, which is truly remarkable for how big it is.  Unfortunately, the game doesn’t have much to find that’s not combat. You’d expect that in a hundred-hour game they would liven things up a bit, but there are no towns, no puzzle shrines, no suspiciously placed rocks that hide collectibles, few platforming challenges, and no hidden paths to jawdropping views. Even so, the content that does exist is pretty great.  BUT IS IT TOO HARD?  Well, no and yes. And ultimately, yes.  It took a few hours to get the basics down, including some advice from my husband. After that, I would characterize it as “challenging but fair”. Even regular mobs deal a lot of damage and you have a very limited supply of healing potions. Traps and ambushes are common.  But it will normally not take you more than a few tries to take out a group of regular enemies, and if it’s too hard you can just move on and come back to slaughter them later. At least for a while.  The bosses are a different story. The boss difficulty is not reliably matched to the difficulty of the dungeon it’s in. Sometimes the bosses are easily dispatched, but often they are absurdly, unfairly difficult. The game seems to be expecting you to try bosses dozens of times before you win.  Many games have implemented this sort of challenge design well, but Elden Ring isn’t one of them. Instead of instantly respawning you near where you failed, the game routinely sticks respawn points several rooms away from the boss chamber, the battles are long with no mid-battle checkpoints, and the death animations and load times are glacial.  I started timing one these battles, and found that for every twenty seconds of fighting the boss, I spent twenty-eight seconds on death animations and loading screens, and another fifty on walking from the respawn point back to the boss chamber. What a waste of time.  Eventually, I gave up on even trying to fight the bosses. Instead, I would clear the rest of the dungeon, unlock the boss chamber, and come back fifteen or twenty hours later to fight the boss. Occasionally, this resulted in a truly epic battle where I survived with a sliver of health. Sometimes, it was a tough but fair challenge. But it most often resulted in a pushover.  Then I got near the endgame (I think), and the game collapsed. I had done every bit of content I could find, and no matter where I went everything was too hard. The five headed dragon guarding the fourth shard? The remaining optional overworld bosses I had skipped?. The optional minidungeon I had skipped? The next legacy dungeon blocking the critical path? Everything was too hard, in every direction.  That was when I gave up, over a hundred hours in.  I probably *could* have cleared it by playing the game’s way, trying each challenge dozens of times, spending the majority of my playtime on loading screens and walking from respawn points to bosses and tough enemies. Or I could have embraced the fact that this is technically a JRPG and ground mobs for hours until I got another twenty  levels. But why? That’s not fun.  BUY OR NO BUY?  Overall, Elden Ring was a bizarre mix of really spectacular top-tier content and frustrating bullshit. This world design is everything I’ve wanted from an open world, so much better than other titles, and the combat is often fair and well-designed.  But the hostility to players who don’t already understand the systems and a terribly implemented “try over and over until you get it right” approach to boss design are really bad.  So should you play it? Well, if  you can mitigate the atrocious load times because you have a current-gen console or high-specs PC. Statistically, you probably don’t, but maybe you do.  You have a friend who already played the game and is willing to advise you.  You’re ok with giving up and not finishing the game.  If you have all this stuff, go for it. Otherwise, skip.  Final rating: 1/10. I feel weird giving a game I spent a hundred hours on such a poor review, but “it was eventually so frustrating I gave up” loses a lot of points. I am biased and copy pasted this review aint no way you read all this just buy this game since its the best thing you will prob do in your entire existence!

Try fingers, but hole
It is really fun and enjoyable
Everyone says the game is amazing. it kinda is dawg.
10/10 this game sets the bar for RPG's.
good game
my favorite part was when melina came up to my grace after i completed the game and said "tarnished, we are the elden ring"
Dork Soul but jump and goat horse   Very cool
You don't need DS and BB anymore. There is a gem
A truly marvelous game experience. No need to deep dive into detail, as there are thousands of in-depth reviews. Worth full price.
Every boss is like going against the final boss.
Very challenging game, lots of content, different types of bosses, large map, quests, good looking outfits, massive choice of weapons. Worth money for real.
Great Game
very good boss fights. Good scenery and wholesome encounters. Also beating strong peolple is a good fealing.
Honestly. This game sucks so much.  But you need to play it
If I tale you is good,would you buy now right?Would you? Ok,is GOOD.
amazing 
Cool
One of the best games I have ever played! I recommend.
Gorgeous, fun, and frustrating.
Time for Elden Ring!
epic 
ELDEN BRING me a rope  Thanks Bill Clinton
Probably my personal favorite game of all time. Everything I loved about the Dark Souls games, set in an open world, with more options to make the overall difficulty more manageable than other From games.
Taxi Driver is a 1976 American neo-noir psychological drama thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Paul Schrader, and starring Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks. Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt New York City following the Vietnam War, the film follows Travis Bickle (De Niro), a veteran working as a taxi driver, and his deteriorating mental state as he works nights in the city.
This is the best fromsoftware game for sure. If you're thinking about jumping into this genre start with this.
Its alright
still maidenless :3
Obsession on dying and try again.
Not at all what I expected from the hype.  This seems like an unfinished game.  The gameplay hasn't been properly been created to work with a keyboard and mouse.
This is literally one of the greatest games I have ever played. Is it perfect? God no. There are plenty of things holding it back from being perfect.  And yet, Elden RIng is still a masterpiece. An awe-inspiring soundtrack, a map of incredible scope, and enough varied and unique encounters to fill up that map to the point that I can still pinpoint the location of wolves in Limgrave. Ridiculous levels of build variety allows for a great deal of replayability. A large cast of unique bosses, many of which have a mountain of buildup that, if you are paying attention, makes you feel like you are facing off against Gods and Titans that should be revered rather than slaughtered.   And, my personal favorite part of all this, Elden Ring is jam-packed with lore. There are ancient civilizations, long-lost deities, body-snatching demons, eldritch horrors, and yet the most pertinent questions that have rattled around in my head for the past year since the game launched pertains to the very characters that you can talk to in-game. If you are willing to sink in the time, you will realize that significant parts of the story do not add up, but hint at secrets to be solved.   Truly, this is a game that I hope developers come to learn from. Not copy, god, please don't copy. Just try and learn from what works, what doesn't work, and be inspired to push the boundaries even further.
pretty decent i guess
very good game 
good game
dont fight tree sentinel at the start unless you want pain
Truly a masterpiece
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE ELDEN RING!!!   THE ELDEN RING! ITS REAL!!!!

vewry good

Awesome game, I never thought I would enjoy a souls game as it always has been déficit to me, but I really enjoy Elden ring great game, beautiful world, is very true the game does not tell you what you have to do, and I had to go and look some help as the game does not explains you very well where you have to go or why you have to do, the story is very impressive and immersive, although not tell by conventional means, the dev rely more on NPCs to tell it. I can see other players complaining of the game being to difficult but it’s all about learning the moves sets, finding your play style, and what makes u more powerful, also this is my first time playing a souls game. Highly recommend, just be wary you are going to suffer if you get upset quickly and rage quit this game is definitely not for you
Absolutely phenomenal.  The craftsmanship that went into this game is well worth the awards it has received to date.  Being a Dark Souls fanboy since the Prepare to Die edition, till now, I got to hand it to them. This is their biggest creation yet in all aspects.  I still remember fondly the greatness that DS1 was, and the challenges with the bad porting and mods we had to go through. Lovely years to say the least.  If this is the direction their next games will be taking, I will be a constant "subscriber".   Marvelous storytelling even for a small patch of land, classically needing to read item descriptions, pay attention to structures and beings, and make connections between them to figure out stories.  Game-play can be as unforgiving as you desire it to be. The art is phenomenal in every aspect, the combat more enjoyable that what I was expecting when I went into the game for the first time. The world is massive and a real treat.   The music OST is outstanding as well, chill-inducing you'd say.  Really looking forward to it's DLC(s).  Only negative issue so far, is some random game crashes when it concerns multiplayer, whether it's Colosseum or invasions (on RTX 3080ti, NVm2, 32GB DDR5, I7-12700).  
Clearly looking at a Turtle the 15 messages surrounding it "Dog"
best game ever
d
Good game very time consuming but worth it.
This game is the best game i have ever had the pleasure of playing
goty no need to say more 
This game deserved the game of the year at its fullest. My experience with it was a very good one, more like a long journey full of mysteries, surpireses and stress (u will rage quit a lot but you guys know this alr beocz its a souls-like game). I did everything i could in the game, it kept me going and going never bored of it, in my oppinion elden ring surpasses the other souls-like games like dark souls and sekiro (but still they are awesome games) and aswell it s an unique expierence. Definitely recommend 10/10
great atmosphere, UI is minimalist but it’s clean and the game not holding your hand and tell you where to go instead you must explore by yourself even if the area is above your level and 1 hit you overall great experiences
i wanted a cool sword and now i gotta put up with a whole marriage 
If you haven't yelled at a video game before (and haven't played the souls games), I promise you this will be your first. There's a huge world to explore and uncountable amounts of secrets. Great combat I would say, and definitely is giving me a challenge.   If you're into really challenging combat, lots of exploring, and wanting to throw a chair and your PC, than this is the game for you.
One of the best video games ever existed.
this shit it ass
The best game I've played in years!
very fun game, can be challenging at times but is best purchase i've made this year
Unbelievable game. Open World, Story, Visuals, Combat and everything in between makes this one of the greatest games every made. Great job FromSoftware!
any praise would be lacking
Love every aspect of this game 
fun game
its like dark souls but bigger
it's elden ring. duh.
Fantastic Game. Would recommended, especially for any dark souls fans, this game is seriously epic.
worth for playing more then 1 time
Souls <3
this is a very good game but also very difficult if is hard for you look up a guide on youtube it is still very much fun
*Liar ahead*  *Why is it always weak foe*
best game
I'M FUCKING YOUR BROTHEEEEEEEEER
nothing comes close to this game
Dog
It's not bad ngl 
yeah quite fun
good
you will die cause you suck :>. the only game that has the B.O.T.W. design done right. new game + when you are hard overlvled feels like B.O.T.W. the first playthrough its a fromsoft game. second play through also :C. I rate it 9.9/10. they dont receive the last 0.1 because fromsoft wants you to suffer i dislike
One of my favourite games. If you want to enter the Souls franchise, this is it. Start here.  Tons of things to do, to explore, builds, tactics... Have fun! 
First off, let me be clear by saying this game is absolutely phenomenal. If you have a really beefy computer. I can tell this is a game that would be one of my favorites of all time, due to some areas being less demanding and running well.   If you're like me and you have a computer only slightly above minimum requirements listed on steam, do not expect to have a good time. If there was a mixed option, I'd pick it, but there isn't so I can't.   This game barely runs at 720p on the lowest settings at an acceptable FPS, and often it will decide to stutter like crazy in some areas, many of those areas coming after you're likely to be eligible for a refund. There are many areas where the instant I walk into it my FPS dips below 10 and stays there, which makes the game run in slow motion. I have tried to the best of my ability to play through it, but I just can't in good faith recommend this to anyone on the fence about if their computer can handle it. I have not had performance nearly this bad in any other Fromsoft game. The minimum performance specs listed below are a lie and in reality you want a computer much better than that for it to run acceptably.  They really need to do better on these ports or at least list their specs more accurately.  EDIT: I managed to get more reliable and acceptable performance by editing my registry to boost the game's CPU priority. This is still a negative review since you should not have to mess with your registry to change CPU priority. Lmao.  After having beaten the game due to being able to not play in a world of slowed time, I can really say this game is incredible, though, so take this review as a recommendation if your computer is significantly better than minimum specs.  That being said, I really hope PC ports of this quality aren't reoccurring trends for Fromsoft.
What hasn't been said already? From Soft did amazing!
Not worth the frustration. Devs are way too reliant on stun locking as "difficulty", enemies always scale to kill you in 2-3 attacks in each new zone and basically cheat, i.e. attacks going through terrain / walls, attacks that have large arcs or invisible areas of effect that don't require actual contact with your model, crappy camera and targeting exploited with cheap one shots, attacks that can't be blocked / parried, etc.. For all the people talking about how this game needs so much skill, they sure seem to miss the point where you don't need skill, it's 100% pattern recognition, and most of the videos you see about this game are meme builds or exploits that avoid the combat the game is somehow praised for. So many assets are re-used that if you can clear the first zone, you'll be set for 95% of the rest of the game. I'm so sick of fighting dragons I just roll my eyes when I see them now.  And then there are bugs. Quest lines can break because you teleported into a place, some NPCs don't appear because you *didn't* teleport into a place, quests that don't begin until you talk to a random NPC on the other side of a map with no indication they would know anything about it. Without the wiki you wouldn't know even half of what's in this game, and with it you just get frustrated by how half assed everything is. Quality of life is a completely foreign concept to these devs.
You can fuck malenia in buthole i recomend this option
Elden ring
This game is awesome! I didn't understand anything, but I really enjoyed playing it!
why is it always rump?
Best game ever.
this game is Game of Thrones / Skyrim meet Dark Souls so... Lots of Fun
This game is just too good
102 hours later, I've completed the game and finally found a maiden. Now I gotta go get the other maidens...
Do i really need to give it a review? IT IS ELDEN RING!!! 10/10
Marvellous game for relaxing.
GOTY
Open world souls game - love it.  Personally, my favorite game of the past 5 years.
man i love witches
pain
dog
I've been playing HARD games since the Atari 2600, and did enjoy my time with Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1/2.  (If you follow a walk-through, disregard my review as you might like the game, being told how to get OP at the start and cruise through the confusing mess that this game suggests you follow and go to completely random points that someone without a guide has no idea about.    But, me, myself buy games to play and explore, I like to complete games myself which is the complete opposite of what Elden Ring REQUIRES)  Elden ring is a joyless exercise in seeing how much you can take before just giving up.  I'm not talking about the combat, I'm talking about the 'apparent' GOLDEN PATH with misleads you into thinking that's what you should be doing.  In-fact, you're better of riding your horse all around this depressing wasteland and collecting random items to make sure you don't go to the first GOLDEN PATH area and just get 1 shot over and over.  Even if you love Demon/Dark Souls, please I beg you, read some proper reviews and even look at the guides showing what a mess this game is.  This is worse than what we'd call a "Nintendo Power Guide" game back in the day...  So much of this game is just there to waste your time, or outright f**k you over, its not worth it.  I'll give one example;  You come to a Castle that is a complete abstraction of what a castle is, makes no sense, and multiple pathes require leaps of faith, lead nowhere, or you have to jump frokm ledge to ledge to get to different parts, But you are getting through it thinking, its confusing as crap and you have no idea where you are and its been a while since a reset point (Lost Grace or some dumb crap).    You walk through a walled area, and you see a Knight you need to fight and know it'll be difficult, but then you swing the camera around and hidden behind a purposely obscured wall is ANOTHER KNIGHT waiting to blast you in the back...  This is a Soul-less game, its designed to be a Youtuber/Steamer/Follow our guide game...  Its not hard, its purposefully wasting your time.
Awesome
The only game I'll ever need.
DLC When?
Yes
[h1] casual [/h1]
super fun game just sometimes may get sooooo confusing but youtube is your friend and i also smashed my headset because it got a boss one hit on my 100th try
i wish its co op and pvp were simplier. i cant find anyone around since its been a while that game came out there are not much players like it used to be.
yes
This game has no sense of where to go or what to do.  You can either follow the provided information to a dead end or you wander into an area where you are not strong enough to fight anything. Just a general sense of not fun and being lost.
10/10 would die again
A true definition of a video game.
A worthy successor to the original Dark Souls and a great first game for anyone new to the genre.
One of the best games ever...
I think they gave me another edition idk, the title screen says "Your A** is not ready for this"  Anyway I enjoyed it a lot 11/10
Probably one of the funnest games I've ever played. Seriously a 10/10, even if you haven't played any of the other souls games.
Fought a crab then had goku sex
Now ive played it, the God of war fans who thought ragnarok was gonna get GOTY over this were clearly Delusional
This game is the best from the Souls series:  1. Enormous and beautiful world. 2. Various and epic bosses. 3. Flexible gameplay (builds/game style). 4. Wonderful atmospheric soundtrack. 5. Possibility for novices to get help (summons/spirits)  I strongly recommend playing the game.
is good
Game of the year absolutely deserved. One of my most favorite games ever.
fun
roll to glory
It's a good.
I really liked how smooth the gameplay was. At no point was I confused or overly frustrated by not knowing what to do or how to accomplish something.
I wanna feel being a beginner again:(
I don't recommend this game to casual players especially those who like to play with friends.    Like all souls games, unless you have hundreds of hours to dedicate to get good at this game it will only frustrate casual players who only have a couple hours a week of gaming time because, you know... life... additionally, though there is a large amount of lure in the game it does a horrific job at telling the story, finding quest givers and littered with translation errors that makes the lure even harder to understand.  script was written in japanese and translated to english... very poorly. even Youtube creators will comment how difficult piecing the story together is.  Furthermore, the game punishes you for playing multiplayer. the moment you enter or welcome a player to your game you are immediately open to invasions forcing you into unwanted pvp. LOTS of griefers in the starting area. don't play with friends if you're just a casual player or get the multiplayer mod (seemlesscoop) where you can play with friends and not deal with stupid unwanted pvp. some players are not into that and shouldn't be forced into it. the game has an arena for pvp, that should be enough...there is a play offline option but then you can't play co-op.  Thank god for modders fixing bad developer decisions.  games like these are always funner playing with friends, why the devs decided to punish you for it is something I will never understand.  another issue is that if you've never played a souls game before be prepared for extreme lack of instruction. there is a small tutorial that shows you how to swing your weapon and move around... aside from that, good luck, figure it out, you're on your own...  long story short. although I will continue playing the game I cannot in good conscious give this game a good review with all the poor development decisions made...
Yo fromsoft, make with a plushie crystal lizard say ~20$ with small velcro pouch accessible from its belly, then sell various different, possibly gachapon based, plushie titanite shards ~3$ that fit within it.  Elden rings pretty neat too.
bad
i have played through this game 3 times (and counting)      This game kinda sucks tbh
Game of the year for a reason :)
its an absolutely amazing game but if you do not have a controller i would not recommend you buy this
Absolutely amazing game from the game-play mechanics themselves to the bosses and atmosphere. I love this game and I believe that this Elden Ring is another amazing game created by FromSoft and truly shows what the Souls-Borne-Sekiro-Ring series has to offer.
Good times
I like the game, although its kinda weird that they made a dating sim a souls like.
Its okay, I guess.
yea it's good
depression into a game
its a cool game, just wish i never played it
gta6 mod
Big dark souls = very good Lore is cool and game is fun 10/10 deserved GOTY Could've used more from Sekiro, (like better camera, parrying with all swords for posture damage, and visible posture bar) and some of the bosses and smaller dungeons and caves could've been fleshed out more. Still a masterpiece, but less consistently good than DS1, Bloodborne, DS3 and Sekiro
Stunlock central
Ranni has nice feet 10/10 game
good game 
Well, thou art of passing skill. Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins, Tarnished
i like to move it mvoe it. GOOD
good game
Fun game with a good difficulty and many ways to approach combat. Exploration is rewarded and is not grindy. 9/10
Absolutley an amazing game 10/10 would recommend 
The premier features of this game not only detract from but directly interfere with what made souls series games good. Fromsoft has barely innovated in 4 games and I'd suggest you steer clear of the worst entry in the souls series. This is a phenomenal game if you thought Skyrim was interesting. A sad step in the wrong direction.
Hidden passage ahead
BEST GAME EVER
Dark Souls 2 is better
Amazing Game
Behold the pickle!
IT WOULD'VE BEEN GAME OF THE YEAR, BUT IT HAD GODSKIN DUOS IN IT! i DIDN'T PAY 40 DOLLARS TO FIGHT GODSKIN DUOS!!!!!!  Edit: Now we cn deVOWA the gods toGETHAAA!
great game
Game of the Year 2022. it deserves its recognition.  I have played every Fromsoft game at this point, and i can confidently say that i think that 'on average' this is by far the best game they have ever made. i say that because i would say that many of their titles seem to excel in 1 subject specifically as compared to Elden Ring.  i would say that;  -Dark Souls 1 has still the best Replayability,  -Bloodborne still captures the audience harder with its Gothic/Lovecraftian theme, setting, and narrative.   -Dark Souls 3 Contends a better Co-op experience, and an almost universally better PVP experience.   -Sekiro has a much more 'perfected' Gameplay (with a sheer lack in Variety due to lack of weapons)  that being said, if all of these other titles are a 10/10 in thier specific catagory of what they did right, the rest of the game doesnt add up to what Elden Ring has done. Elden Ring has made it so that every thing they did was a 8-9.5/10 so every thing about this game, is at least great, if not perfect. and then the sheer quantity of content in this Game easily dwarfs most of the other titles by a landslide. why Liurnia, Elden Rings 3rd Zone, which is only about 12% of its map. is aruably the same size as all of Dark Souls 1.  so to summarize. Elden ring isnt necessarily the best in very aspect compared to previous From Titles, i would however say that it is at least the 2nd best at everything those previous ones excelled at. and they delivered everything together is such sheer quality, and Quantity, that this is essentially one of the best games that I personally have ever played.  So all in all, I'd give Elden Ring (Pre-DLC) a 9.7/10
There are times in a man's life that he must rise to an occasion, challenge himself, and bring honor to his bloodline. This game is not the place to do that. You will submit yourself to over 100 hours of cock and ball torture and still never get close to the satisfaction of finishing. You will die over and over and over again. Eventually you'll descend into madness, and give up all hope of ever enjoying this game. 10/10 best game I have ever played, can't recommend enough.
So much content it's like 5 games rolled into 1.  This is a quality game,  only needed some improvement with the soundtrack and story
Difficult to recommend this game.  I put in maybe 30 hours and gave up.  Was not about all that grinding.  Hours of grinding just didn't seem to help my stats or my skills. I'm probably just good lol.  After a while, the grinding seemed tedious and boring.  Very immersive and beautiful open world, though.
good good game 
boring
the best game for 2022
not recommended if you have anger issues trust me...
Disappointment of the year 2022
dark souls 2
It's great
Its so silly
good!
Fun Game and without a doubt worth the money.
Absolute 10/10 such a great game, and gameplay definitely not as hard as the other souls games 
very good
good game
Just keep trying
excellent game
Well,what can I say,this game has its ups and downs,but overall at the end of the day I can say that its deserving the GOTY title,its a huge world with lots of bosses,u have a lot of options when it comes to combat and character builds,a lot of exploration,and the lore its kinda nice BUT its not for everbody,u need a lot of pacience too,and to have some nerves and neurons to throw away because u die a lot,i mean,a LOT in this game and sometime u need to play with wiki or youtube in front of you because the game doesnt tell u shit about almost anything,u are on your own when it comes to story progress or quests
probably one of the best games i have ever played
How to play Elden Ring (correctly)  Look for dog Find a dog Praise the dog  Repeat
put these foolish ambitions to rest.
Game difficulty is set to lethal from the start which makes it hard and frustrating to learn, being one shot in the tutorial by a psuedo-boss at the end is saying something.  The game's design is very unusual as it shows a level of focus on killing the player that I have not experienced in other games, something that is apparent with the very high death count I've accrued.    I quantify my appreciation for this game in comparing it to Witcher 3, a game I played up to the hardest setting 'Death March' and logged over 1000 hrs.  In the first 30 minutes of Witcher 3 I found the game to be fun, interesting, and wishing to play more.  In the first 30 minutes of Elden Ring I found myself asking how is it I avoid dying in combat to exacting parry timers, advanced enemy AI, and vague scaling in enemy strength.    At this point I've cleared the Tree Sentinel and three minor bosses in caves, in lieu of satisfaction of achievement it's just the relief of one less thing trying to chase me down and kill me.  The encumbering system of relying on potions to recover and hoping to find the next respawn point mirrors the relief as treading water is a reality because everything respawns if you rest to refill the potions which can place a drag on progress.  I am skeptical that I will finish the game with the trend it carries on with.  I would say this game appeals to people who enjoy balancing on the edge of a knife, because it doesn't seem meant for the average gamer.  I had wondered why there were rage videos on Youtube for the game, while I can't say a game can incline me to such a response now I can feel sympathy for their irritation.
Some actions from certain bosses and NPC’s feels racially motivated. Otherwise fun game 10/10.
it was a really refreshing experience, loved it :)!
Very Cool
to hard 
Arguably the best game I've ever played. Can't wait for it's DL.
it's not really dark souls but it's still good in its own way
It is honestly addicting
try finger  but hole
Changed my life for the better
maidens  10/10 
After many hours of playtime, I can safely say Elden Ring is a game that I've played
This is without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made. An endless world of challenge, gorgeous art, and discovery that will not cease to bring an utterance of astonishment at every turn. This game is a masterpiece that constantly calls for more adventure!
Only game i ever got on steam that i finished and wants to play even more, replay it and try a bunch of build. Game is actually fun. Did not feel like a chore. 100% would play again and recommend
Insane
W Game. Not broken besides hit reg on pvp. tons of replayability if your willing to spend a day or two figuring out the bosses. good comunity but some furrys. def worth $60.
Made me suicidal
recently had a traumatic experience (slept with someone i shouldn't but it wasn't my fault) and as a result i (24m) was grounded. so i bought this game and has very much helped me though my time locked in my room. the only downside there is next to no dialogue which is okay but i can't talk to my family right now especially not my step mom but otherwise an outstanding game with a compelling yet confusing storyline. I regret with everything i have the choices I've made but this game has helped me process and move forward. also my first soulslike game just FYI to help you understand where i'm coming from
gud game, get dead, get gud
One of the best games i have ever played
yes
Happiness, saddness, happiness, saddness, this game is amazing  10/10 buy it
this is a memorable and intensely large game with a lot of the right choices in open world gaming... and the port is like a burnt corpse. Get in on console unless you want to play offline with the anti cheat disabled.
it's the goat
solid 
not just another pick up a quest and follow mission lines. some thought is actually put into it. However, for pc controls i would say going with keyboard and is fine but needs to have more flexible key binds.
good me like
game
to good
dont hug girls they only weaken you
GOOD 
nice
Game of the year. enough said
GAME GOOD. thats it 
good game
Dog.
you need to get this game I absoultley love it unfortunatley when I beat it i did not get an achievement for beating the final boss but I am sure people know I beat this game because I beat Melinia and she is really hard with the waterfowl move
You know this game is worth your money, you don't need me to tell you that.
too easy
Death......enough said
Sekiro was fun af but the dark souls community hated it because it wasn't dark souls, so they removed everything that made Sekiro fun.   If you like dark souls you will probably like this, not really my cup of tea.  ALSO HOLY SHIT FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUCKING PORT A GAME ALREADY JESUS CHRIST
it's elden ring
this game is stupid hard and there is no direction... aimless wondering with nothing to accomplish
great 
Dont buy
‎ ☀️  \[T]/
good game
Best game I've played so far . I can't find words to tell how good this game was and how much I've enjoyed every second of playing it . THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE / MUST PLAY
FromSoftware's magnum opus, need i say more?   Yes i still need to gitgud
This game is supper fun and hard. I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants a challenge.
Masterpiece 11/10
will make you want to die
great game
Great game 
It's the best Fromsoft game to date. Bar none.
Very fun, landscape is beautiful.you can speak with a big jar.  One big problem, for me at least, there is one boss i can't beat: soldier of godrick! 
still maiden-less :(
I beat the game and I think its fair to say that this shit is ass. I do not recommend at all. Mid/10

vvery good
Dorah thy Exployier
good
yes because good
One of the most epic rpgs I’ve ever played-and I’ve played a lot since my first experience with Daggerfall back in ‘96. Even if you are new to the Souls-like genre, very rewarding game. Game does not hold your hand but the customization options in the level system are both eloquent and straight forward. Not an easy game by any stretch, but if you persist you will learn. 98/100 for me.
adicting
If you like Dark Souls, but bigger, this game is for you. At first I was skeptical about the open words, but I'm 100 hours in and I love every second of exploring this amazing world. The only negative I can think of is that this is not the Dark Souls world, but it's own thing. (still great)
Very good game
good

Crazy good 
This is a true Masterpiece.
Stunning visuals , challenging game play and amazing lore
Slammed my balls into a waffle iron. hot.
I play this to scratch the tabletop itch; so many places to go and see, so many ways to build a character, and something inextricably compelling that keeps you coming back for more. Highly recommend the Seamless CoOp mod so you can ride with the boys wherever and whenever. Playing the way you want is the highlight here, so feel free to ignore the frothing of the anti-fun hoards. The Elden Throne is yours for the taking, and it isn't a matter of if, but how.
Good game
Positive just because I really like the visuals.  With respect to everyone who adore this game, I find it to be nothing special. Actually it is bit boring for me. For people who really want to go in to long term development of their character, love to micro manage all the percentages, it can be fun. But basically it is just kill, get stronger so you can kill more. If it wasn't for very unique visuals and characters I would abandon this game long ago. In relation to character I know game wanted to go for a very unique feel but every character sounds like they have a severe iron deficiency.  Lore is unique but individual stories in the game are nothing new. I've been gaming for a long time and have seen similar stories, and have seen better stories. (PS I have just 33 hours in game but have seen a lot of videos about it).  To best explain Elden Ring it is like making a castle out of cards. it will take skill, time, sweat and tears but at the end of the day, not really worth it.  Elden Ring is like this post, TLDR. Except for some people.   If I have to give points, this game would get 5/10.    
Fun game skill issue if you didn't beat Maliketh
Death and pride
h............................ tarnished!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best single player game ever.
Amazing and hard game defently recommend for people who loves MMORPG's worth the 60 bucks not gonna lie.
A very good game full of adventure, great graphics with a degree of difficulty
The first entry into the game was simply unsurpassed - something new, open the world and go wherever you want.  But it quickly ended, when the bosses introduce themselves as bosses from Sekiro, in which sequence it takes place, a stuffy empty world, and I even then tried to ride a horse in search of something interesting. -10 out of 10. This is dark soul impotence when you fight opponents from other game series. Demon Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro games will probably be iconic because they are unique. All the rest of the games are copy paste on the same place.  And what kind of Tanimura-style bullshit: a bunch of mobs in one place, an unclear plot and dishonest bosses similar to Sekiro. While it may not be to blame for the bosses, there are many aspects I hate about Dark Souls 2.  I guess I have a small question for the game: you didn't explain anything at the beginning and didn't give a normal introduction, but why is the game called Elden ring if we are constantly going to the tree? Perhaps Elden Tree is a better name, although not pathetic.
gud gaim
Great game.  I started this game expecting to die multiple times (and that is exactly what happen) but the rush you feel when defeating a boss is amazing.  The game has no bugs, that i could find.
Maidenless :[
Amazing graphics and awesome lure
rump, therefore offer finger
If this game isn't a masterpiece, I don't know what is. Low replayability but otherwise well worth it. Got my copy during 2022 winter sale for $50.
Aftermath of Elden Ring:  1.Headphones snapped in 6 different places. 2.Both controllers in pieces. 3.Dodge button has disintegrated. 4.Monitor has endured severe damage. 5.Keyboard smashed on desk, few keys remain. 6.My mic has tolerated ear bleeding decibels after killing the foreskin duo. 7.Straight up hole punched through my PC. 8.Large chunk of my desk straight up gone, reduced to atoms. 9.Several holes kicked in the wall. 10.Chair ripped to shreds.  Good game yeah 
yes
faster paced, better looking Dark Souls. With more sorcery.
i could have spent this money on an o-ring
I love this game so much
amazing game until endgame, where it falls off hard - bosses are hit or miss, map design is pretty much linear after leyndell which means worse exploration (which was the game's best feature up until this point); also game has waaaaay too much copypasting of bosses, which maybe can be excused for many of the enemies, but bosses like astel and godrick just shouldn't be reused; elden beast is a disappointing final boss both in gameplay (due to lack of torrent) and story (radagon is hyped up the whole game and elden beast shows up unexpectedly as phase two)
Its elden ring play it
Elden Ring is my favorite soulsborne. This game FUCKS with a capital F
by far one of the best games i've ever played
great game, extremely fun gameplay, highly replayable... 10/10 would recommend. very good very nice
Pain, suffering, agony, torture, patterns, bullshit   100/10 would die again
good game far from perfect soo much potential, highly recommend
The game is great honestly, it has its downsides but they aren't that big of a deal. If you are new to a "Souls-like" then understand that the game is not meant to guide you through it, you are meant to explore, and be challenged by the enemies, so Expect to die, alot at that. after bashing your head against a boss a dozen times and finally beating them, you'll get a sense of true achievement. If an enemy is to hard then find a new path or explore a new area. The "Main Story" is elusive if you don't pay attention to dialogues and the cut scenes. and there are multiple endings based on how or what you do in the game. Perhaps to helping a Certain NPC or killing another will change the outcome. Again if you wanna be challenged try the game out with an open mind, and if you don't like Challenged... Idk go play COD. 😅
I walked about 1.5km in game. Everything was going great, was picking flowers and enjoying the vistas. I decided to walk down to the beach. It was beautiful, everything was peaceful and I felt secure. That's when I saw 2 goblins about 300 meters ahead. I hid behind a cliff wall, and discovered the entrance to a cave. I entered the cave. And never got out alive. Turns out it was a goblin cave, in trying to avoid 2 goblins on the beach I fell on an army of goblins in the cave. I was not ready for this.
good game 
Great game! World is fresh and amazing. Bosses are very diverse in move set and design, and you have almost an unlimited amount of choices for what build you use.
Grind your way through dozens of reskinned enemies to spongy bosses that one-shot kill you at a glance
iz good
Open world
10 out of 10 perfect game
Fromsoft the GOAT
finally beaten the game, with all boss and side boss defeated (still cant imagine there are 200+ boss in this game)   story is fantastic, never thought i would be so invested on the lore of this game. gameplay is great. even though i die multiple times, i keep coming back because its that addicting lol  totally deserves the game of the year award. 10/10
i dont recommend this game because i beat it and its boring now and i dont like it so you shouldnt buy it
Elden Ring is a must-play for fans of action role-playing games. The combination of FromSoftware's renowned gameplay mechanics and George R. R. Martin's worldbuilding expertise results in a rich and immersive experience. The open world is vast and stunning, filled with interesting characters, challenging enemies, and hidden secrets to discover. The combat is satisfying and strategic, with a variety of weapons and magic spells at the player's disposal. The online multiplayer adds an extra layer of excitement, allowing players to join forces and tackle difficult battles together. The story is well-written, drawing players into the world of Elden Ring and making them feel invested in the journey to repair the titular Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord. Overall, Elden Ring is a triumph of game design, delivering an unforgettable experience that will keep players entertained for hours on end.
Love the open world aspect of this game and the bosses are great. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games like The Elder Scrolls, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild and any fans of other souls games.
very gud
first let me start by saying this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the sense of discovery is unbelievable. you can see a lot of inspiration from breath of the wild and i was a massive fan of that game as well. i tend to juggle games but all i want to play is Elden Ring. the art direction and beauty is jaw dropping.  i am only 50ish hours in and just started scratching the surface of this massive open world game. elden ring plays very well on the steam deck and that's how i have been spending most of my time in this world. i love the fact the Fromsoft made this game very accessible without turning the difficulty down. this is still very much a souls game just very defined with elements of all there games stacked in this one game. you can see the talents from this company getting better and better with every entry. fighting the bosses have never been better without the losers walk of shame back to the boss arena. this alone has made this souls game a lot more accessible and more enjoyable in my opinion. i personally don't write reviews and this is my first one on steam but think this game is so good that it deserves one. if i can talk just one person into getting this game i would be happy as Godrick taking a axe to the arm.   no matter how many reviews you may read and watch there are still big suprises around every corner. stumbling upon a cave when you think you have checked every nook and cranny is a  incredible feeling just to make you mind race with what could possibly be in there. i know i am all over the place and doing nothing but gushing but this game truly is that good and that incredible. if Elden Ring is this good then i can only imagine how flushed out there next game will be. i can see why this is game of the year and maybe even game of the decade.
Touch grass
everything i could have wanted in a game
bad game
fingers butt hole
tough but fun
Difficult, but absolutely beautiful to play, and only difficult if you're getting greedy with your attacks! Very intuitive to work out what you need to do - even if you're not the best gamer!
As with any game with a dodge-roll, there's only two ways to make it difficult; adding jank or forcing the player to avoid multiple attacks at once. Elden Ring goes for the former, adding start-up frames to your dodge roll and large, lingering hitboxes for enemy attacks. There's a large amount of recycled content, hitbox issues when using small weapons, and rather linear progression despite trying to be an open-world. My final issue is that because FromSoftware is always trying to one-up the difficulty of the game, bosses end up having infinitely extendable combos, punishing you for trying to learn a boss and squeeze as many hits out as possible. This issue is only exacerbated by certain near-undodgeable attacks, such as Margit's/Morgott's triple swing, Godrick's wind gust start-up, and Radagon's elden shattering.
.
I absolutely adore this game, the graphics are beautiful, and make me wish I myself were exploring the lands between. The gameplay is much like other dark souls games, but much smoother, and in my opinion, engaging. The story is like that of no other, and the game doesn't feed you any of the lore, its scattered throughout item descriptions, quests, cutscenes, and other npc dialouge. The game promotes exploration and even gives you tools to help on your journy, such as torrent, the goat horse thing, your spectral steed who will take you through the lands between. The game has so many build options, you can practically play the game any way you like. All characters have some kind of lore for you to find, the music in this game is also another point that I'd like to cover, it is absolutely stunning. All in all, I would reccomend this game a thousand times over, but keep in mind it is still a souls game, so expect difficulty, but do not break, I believe in you all my fellow tarnished, and I wish you luck in your adventures in seeking out the Elden Ring.
This game is very very good. Steep learning curve but extremely satisfying when you get the hang of it.
imagine not playing this game lol!
it good

Still waiting for a DLC...

Now I know why Elden Ring won best game of 2022. I regret not playing this earlier.
"Elden Ring is a triumph in gaming, with responsive and engaging combat, impeccable world design, and brilliant lore. From the moment you start playing, you are transported to a vast and immersive world, filled with secrets to uncover and mysteries to solve. The combat system is responsive and fluid, allowing players to switch between weapons and magic with ease. The world design is top-notch, with hidden regions, legacy dungeons, optional bosses, and hidden questlines providing a wealth of bonus content that elevates the game to new heights. The lore of Elden Ring is expertly crafted, slowly revealing the history and secrets of the world as the player progresses. The story is so well done that you are left eager for more, eagerly awaiting the release of any future DLC. Elden Ring is a must-play for fans of action-RPGs and anyone who appreciates a well-crafted gaming experience."
The game is amazing I got pissed a lot The pvp is an absolute dumpster fire of a mechanic the metas need to be fixed and that's about it still an amazing game
elden ring
One of the best games ever made. Even if you are not a soul's like game fan you should play Elden Ring. Massive map, a lot of quests, amazing characters, enemies and surreal bosses. You will enjoy dozens of hours playing this world, believe me! The only thing you should be aware of is that, if you are not used with From Software games ( end even if you are used to them), you will feel clueless a lot of times, so be ready to search for wikis os videos in the net to find a path from time to time.
amazing gameplay and the game looks nice but i found a few bugs like an enemy hitting me from outside the boss room but apart from that it was an amazing game and i had a really good experience with it
YOU DIED
An open world soulsborne game.. what is there not to like?
THE GAME PLAY. ITS FLUID AND THE AI IS AMAZING...
They never removed the Bandicamp white screen that burns my eyes every time I start the game up.  Still a good game, just causing my physical pain.
maidenless
A sense of accomplishment and self-esteem is available if you work hard enough for it.
i love this game
AMAZING
a work of art
Great souls game. Not my favorite, but the first play through is really something special. must buy. The visuals alone in this game are better then 100% of triple A games these days.
good game
Game made me want to shoot myself. Very good
best game ever 
its good
LOVED IT
Good price to content
tough asf
remove the enemies that have the rapier + fire pulley crossbow thing pls
yes
Best fromsoftware game. I recommend it.
If your a PC gamer and expecting an easy to use UI Don't get this game. IMO this game was made for console and as such for game pad.   I should be able to have a key binding for every action in game and yet this UI forces you to use a game pad idea (Press X button to scroll to Y option)  It is an horrendously clunky at best Broken at worst when you can't select what you need in a single button press in the heat of a fight.   If I could refund this console designed rubbish I would. But as such I leave this down vote review as a warning to all mouse and keyboard users.
After all the hype and reviews I thought I would like Elden Ring, but it just isnt for me.  It seems too story light while graphically amazing.  Im just not into random hack and slash, and this what the game feels like
Most fun I've ever had being intensely frustrated
it solid and a decent
awesome....awesome....awesome
Leaving a positive review to offset a friends negative, (His Night and Flame build guide got him stuck on Fire Giant).
ah ye pretty good for a indie game
i'm still having fun, while offline
Elden Ring is the first first souls/souls-like game I have ever played and it does not leave a good impression on the genre and the team at From Software. For a game released in 2022 It is about 10 years behind what would be expected for this era of gaming. Firstly this game is capped at 60 fps which is a sheer let down, even new gen consoles can run at 120+ fps so they had literally no excuse. Even the PC community was able to fix this within a few days of release so it cant of been that hard for a AAA gaming studio. (using the communities fix removes all online features which is why I did not use it). Furthermore the PC port for Elden Ring is terrible, controls are clunky and clearly designed for controllers, fortunately you can rebind right, well yes you can but From Software managed to fuck this up as well leaving PC players with minimal options compared to other games. If any other AAA game was released in this state they would be ridiculed beyond belief by the community. In conclusion the technical aspects of this game are severely dated for this generation of gaming and there is no one else to blame but the team at From Software and their incompetence to produce a game even mildly up to standard with the times.
10/10, love this game, absolutely legendary, incredibly stressful, would recommend.
Git gud
good
Perfection.
please inform your family and friends that you will be unavailable for the forseeable future if you purchase this game
Play this if you also enjoy getting your balls crushed by a hydraulic press. ;) Best game 10/10 
If you are a keyboard+mouse gamer like I am, I very much do NOT recommend this game. The controls are absolutely fricking atrocious! I literally cannot stress enough just how god damn terrible they are and From Software really did not even so much as *TRY* to make them reasonable.  I got the game as a gift and I will attempt to finish playing through with it with the coop-mod, but if I had bought it with my own money, I would've refunded the game already.
It is a good game and I like it, but for me at least, I still have Xbox controller guides and tutorials while playing PC with mouse and keyboard. My copy also still has frame rate issues too and the worst part is that I don't know if they have fixed it or not. I decided to wait to play it on the likelihood that they would fix it and when I see other people play it on Youtube and such, they seem to have no problems at all, but when I play on my PC my problems still remain. If you have any tips or tricks on how to fix the copy please let me know.
im mentally disturbed
Excellent Game!
good
It's fun, i recommend
It's Elden Ring, do I need to say more?
dlc when?
This game is hard but fun and most of the fun comes from the difficulty and to refresh the game you can get a randomizer
A bit difficult at the start but once you get to know the game it is fun.
A game must play in the 21st century
fuck this peace of shit game I got banned for what? IDK! 180 days, ok ok I waited 180 days I log back in, hello hello welcome back 180 day ban to you once more. I uninstalled the game I deleted my save fuck this game.
Great and challenging game, would recommend to all and a great game for all.
After spending 100 hours yet to see all the content this game has to offer. So yeah, well worth the money spent.
.
fun game, certain achievements don't properly unlock no matter what i do so there goes 100% completion
fun until i got to the fire giant
So glad steam rejected my refund of this game after I bought it to play with a mate, and finding out the co-op system is crap. Some 400 hours later, and this has climbed to the top of my favourite game of all time. Graphics, story and major bossfights 10/10. Some minor complaints might be that they have re-used alot of minor bosses in caves, catacombs and open world, not a big complaint, but feels abit un-rewarding when you get to the end of something and see the same boss you already fought 3-4 times. Highly recommanded
BEAUTIFUL! The devs really outdid themselves in world crafting. Unfortunately, the devs also want you to have a terrible experience in exploring this amazing world. They stuffed ambush, mini-boss fights, and all sorts of shenangians in every corner of the map. Whenever you feel like exploring, you just end up dying from unnecessary surprises. The devs want you to die every five minutes or so. Oh, look what a nice view over there, let's go check it out. Whoops, a crucible knight jumps out of nowhere and obliterates you. As soon as you die, the game respawns all enemies and you lose your progress. The bosses are ludicrously aggressive and don't play by the same rules as you do.   I am not whining because I couldn't beat them. I destroyed every one of them, even the disgustingly crazy Goddess of Rot fight. Check my achievements if you don't believe me. Those fights aren't enjoyable and you just want to get it over worth as soon as possible.   The devs built such a beautiful world. Unfortunately, they only want you to have PTSD rather than an enjoyable experience.
This shit gas But just buy it when It SELL too expensive
 in search of elden ring
enjoy
First off this game is my first from software game i have never played DS 1-3 i tried 3 and left it after 20 times dying to Gundyr. I had a lot of fun with this game and it has replay value but big time. You scale very slow at first, for me it was the 10h mark in the first playthrough. After that most of the content was very well designed & scaled. Of course there are some things which are doable solo but somethings like the Godskin Duo i would recommend doing with an Ash or another player. Speaking of which helping players out is a fun addition to the game or getting helped there are things which just kicked my butt the first time around like the fallingstar beast it was cake with the help of an fellow magician Tarnished. All in all now i love the soul games and I will try playing DS 1-3.
precious item ahead
Excellent game, with huge variations of build, and a good mix of grinding or skill needed
great
This game is good. I like how you can swing your sword and then the enemies die, but sometimes you die too. Wow! Video game
Outstanding!
recommend
best game
I tried and I tried.  I even used a couple of mods to try and get into this game.  Unfortunately, this style of game, even though it's a Game of the Year game I personally do not like hack-and-slash games but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wish there was a way to gift a game you own to someone else, as I would.
There is a big bubble "hammer" enough said.
What an incredible journey, I finally completed Elden Ring almost one year after buying it and 100+ hours. I really enjoyed this one, it was one of those games I thought about and wondered what to do next even when not playing it. After completing it I started Playthrough 2 and I'm excited to travel back through the lands again. The community are brilliant and helped carry me through some of the more difficult bosses. As a Dark Souls fan this game took some of the best parts from the series with new improvements and changes and made it into a huge open world.
I'm very surprised by the variety in mechanics, the landscape and the level of thought given to the quests (and consequences of said quests). The theme and story of the game is overall quite dark, but that was to be expected.  Great game with boss fights that force you to think, usually there isn't just one best solution. If you like to be challenged this is the right game for you. Can't wait for more!
qwertyuiop
10/10 best game
GOY and try some video from Carbot animation is funny
There are two builds. Dex and Magic. Change my mind.
I killed Kenny Haight accident revive pls
I usually play Fantasy RPG with vibrant-themed world. Ive trid Dark Souls on my friend's PC and its really hard for a first timer into Fromsoftware games. You can easily hardlocked into a boss and cant progress without defeating it first, and the world is grim from the start. In Elden Ring you can appreciate the beuty of the world first before seeing the grim part of it, and it'll make you appreciate the lore behind it more. and when you struggling with a boss you can go somewhere else and make you character stronger as well knowing the games mechanic while doing so. The only boss required to progress the story is at the end of the story and by then you will already know the game's mechanics and character build is done. So you can appreciate the combat more by the end. Really recommends this game if you were interested in Fromsoftware games. It'll help you get acquainted with the mechanics first.
most addictive pain 10/10
Fun game, hard as shit
Absolutely beautiful game. The world is unique and breath taking, while the story doesn't lack at all! Overall a 10/10 game for me and completely understand why it won game of the year. Will be playing more on New Game + for sure!
so true
was good
good
Before starting the actual review, huge thanks to [b]director: Hidetaka Miyazaki[/b], [b]writer: George R. R. Martin[/b] and last but not least the [b]development team: FromSoftware[/b] for creating this beautiful and still "git gud" challenging video game for us to enjoy.  Also congratulation for winning the [b]The Game Awards 2022 - Game of the Year[/b] and the [b]Steam Awards 2022 - Game of the Year[/b] trophies at least (on top of the bunch of other awards).  TL;DR If you have liked the previous Dark Souls games or looking for real challenge from a action RPG genre, you just don't have any excuses for NOT to playing the [b]ELDEN RING[/b]. [b][u]It's that awesome and worth of every single coin you put into it.[/u][/b]  For those who haven't tried out any of previous Dark Souls related games, I really recommend you to give it a try. Like previous games Elden Ring gives you life lessons of not giving up when you face the impossible obstacle, there is always solution to get pass that, even if it means making decisions that are not easy.  Started playing with Intel i7-8700K & RTX 3080 -> a bit over middle way through upgraded to AMD 7600X & RTX 3080.  This review is written in POV of character with following setup (can contain spoilers);  [spoiler]Magic caster (lvl 165 50,50,30,13,13,70,8,10), no summons & spirit/war ashes used, no parrying, no great runes activated, no PVP, Malenia and every other boss beaten in single playthrough, zero respeccing, zero guides watched.[/spoiler]   [h2][b]Story & Graphics and Environment[/b][/h2] Following the similar path as the previous [b]FromSoftware[/b] games, the [b]Elden Ring[/b] moves story forward via cutscenes and having conversations with NPC's. You won't get every necessary detail right away, but inspecting the environment, NPC's told stories and item texts, give you at least some knowledge of this vast, mystic and gruesome story and game lore.  To get the whole picture, I recommend watching an video from YouTube after finishing the game. I will guarantee you'll be shocked to find some of the NPC lore and backgrounds later.  The game doesn't include a "Quest-tracker" itself, but some guidance is provided by the map. This means you might accidentally skip some "cool side-quests". To those who really want to see every bit of story, I recommend following community tools like Wiki or YT videos.  Once opening the first doors, you'll be welcomed to the 'the Lands Between'. The visuals and environment almost made me cry, for just being alive to experience this kind of magnificent graphical output. It's just so life-like and unreal at the same time. Being playing at the same time couple other open-world RPG games but their visual output isn’t even near what [b]Elden Ring[/b] is able to produce.  Few YT channel recommendations (not all Lore related): [url=https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya/videos]VaatiVidya[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxgcx0CKkjo9lE40sUdRjhTHfF6XORub]Zullie the Witch[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@ymfah/videos]ymfah[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/@Fextralife/playlists]Fextralife[/url].     [h2][b]Gameplay[/b][/h2]  What can I say, the 'git gud' mentality will get you eventually. The game sets quite early that world isn't fair for you. You'll encounter many enemies and bosses with different movement, attack patterns alike, which some may be easy for your current build. Eventually you'll face the most absurd obstacle where it can get frustrated to continue. But be smart, learn from your mistakes and change/upgrade few things and brake through like a wrecking ball.   Movement was the very key of my playthrough, and the Light/Medium armor sets felt at the end the best option. There is definitely better ways to play out than my way, but after unlocking certain "mixture", magic felt overpowered as I was able to Kamehame-haa the bosses straight to face and beat it under 10 seconds (this said thou I was also in some cases way above the enemies or the area level itself).  Guarantee there is some even brain dead builds available on lower level to beat every boss of the game but that is the main aspect of the gameplay itself. You have the vast variety of options to move, attack, defend and ease the gameplay to the max if necessary.  This is also the thing I'd like to see in other open-world RPG genre games in the future. [b]*Cough*, other AAA-game studios, please other take notes and put them into your games, but not behind a paywall.. Thank you.[/b]   [h2][b]Soundtrack[/b][/h2]  Once you start the game, your ears are going to bleed of liquefied diamonds. It is like a another dimension gods were living just to place every track preciously to time freeze bubble, so once you step inside of it. You're the one who lives the moment of an epic tale of the game.  Soundtrack is an masterpiece of an composer work from [b]Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo[/b] and the orchestra work from The Budapest Film Orchestra. Do check out the [url=https://bandainamco.lnk.to/Elden_Ring_ST]Official Soundtrack[/url] even if you haven't purchased the game yet.   [h2][b]Conclusion[/b][/h2]  [b]ELDEN RING is the best game ever made on year 2022 (and probably 2023).[/b] Buy it, play it, enjoy it, suffer from it and git gud you [b]Tarnished one[/b].
smelden cheese
quite a nice game it has a big map high veriety of weapons armor and play stiles when you do start the game you will probably strugle since the fighting mechanics are quite finicy and you need to be percise with ur attacks as well as ur timing for dodges however when you do get those basic fighting moves and such its all just smooth road ahead the rest is more or less equipment
this game crashes my pc
:)
game sucks
btw i just love this game  
This is truly one of the games of all time
nice 
Not fun to deal with this much difficulty
Yes
double uchigatana shawerma master
 ** spoiler alert** depressing all your friends die by your hand and thats the good ending..
Way to hard. The Tower Knight in Gold at the very beginning is so hard if this slog is what I am in for then no thank you. It worse then dark souls. 25 min in the game became so difficult it was not fun anymore. What am I suppose to kill sheep in this limited area until I can take this Gold Knight on? He kills me in three hits and I have to land at-least 30 to 40 on him, how is that even fair this early in the game?!?!? I refunded this trash and you guys are nuts.
Absolutely amazing game and would recommend. The map is so beautiful and when you first go outside and open that door, its one of he most beautiful things you will have seen in a video game. Bosses are tough here and there but are not impossible. The reward is defeating them, not what they drop. Such a great game, 10/10 would recommend.
Cooming
Finally after thousands of hours playing video game on my entire life. I found just the right character that i can feel the relateability to the point i can proudly say that i subconsciously self insert myself to it and no, i'm not talking about our beloved yet maidenless tarnished. I believe that learning something just for the sake of thing we loved is something that we can all correlate with.   After all i said even though i can't even remember how many time tree sentinel's BONKED me to oblivion, the scenery of passing stars after the general passing will always within my heart. I agree with anyone who said that this game deserve 10/10 even at the end of the day i had to burn my newfound maiden.
Love this game. First souls game as well
most disappointing game ive ever played and i played anthem
FUN
w game
Pretty fun too easy
I THINK THAT THIS GAME IS SUPER GOOD AND FUN
Only play if you hate your self. Otherwise great game!
Best colonoscopy simulator 2022-2023

got to malenia thought it would be hard like the other bosses but not to hard didn't think i would be fighting the representative of death
it's decent
ffjfhfkhkhjhgjgjhjg
bad game
If you're an avid fan of CBT, this game is for you!  Punishing game play and stunning graphics, with a pretty in depth story if you talk to the right NPC's and read item descriptions.  in early 2022 this game came out and I wasn't really too excited to spend 80$ on a video-game, but fortunately my friends pushed me into it and it is probably the only game I've ever played that could justify an 80$ price tag. I might be total garbage at Elden Ring but even if you can't beat a boss by skill you can always just farm and comeback a mega-hulk and do 50% of their health bar per hit. which some will say takes away from the FromSoft experience but I think it makes this game more accessible to a wider audience. Thanks for the great 110 hours FromSoft, I'm looking forward to 110 more.

very low replayability
This is a beautiful game.  Some of the game mechanics have been a little slow for me to get used to but it's a lot of fun and definitely has some challenges that are very rewarding when defeating a particular enemy type that's handed your but to you a few times.  I'm sure I'll be playing many hours of this yet to come.
Absolutely fantastic excuse to spend your money, this game will come with as many deaths as CoD but with 100x more gameplay and satisfaction upon killing an enemy
Bought the game. Played the game. Still a maidenless runt

It's good, I'm not. 10/10
     ㅤㅤㅤㅤ
Good game
super easy and trash game had to 100% so review is valid mobs are harder than boss i wanted to kill myself exploring the last areas and i lost a lot of braincells when the bosses were huge and the camera was locking in their ass and the agro to never open the map oml trash never again but map and voice and sountracks are beautiful
Earned GOTY
The parts where you explore the open world, the underground areas, and all that are really fun, but its filled to the brim with misery mechanics and annoying bosses. Play Dark Souls 2 instead.

About to hit NG+6 on Xbox and decided to start 100%'ing the Steam achievements as well. One of my favorite games out there. It can have a rough start if you've never played a souls game before, but once you get the hang of it you'll really start to appreciate how great of a game it is.
First souls genre game and I didn't realize what I was missing.
yes
GOATED
very good
Despite the insane levels of malding it will cause you, its a phenomenal game start to finish.
Overall, Elden Ring was a bizarre mix of really spectacular top-tier content and frustrating bullshit. This world design is everything I’ve wanted from an open world, so much better than other titles, and the combat is often fair and well-designed.  But the hostility to players who don’t already understand the systems and a terribly implemented “try over and over until you get it right” approach to boss design are really bad.
fun
dark moon greatsword
played for 126hrs.. havent even gotten past the second stage. 10/10.

yes
ELDEN RING
Games a massive pain in the ass, but its so damn good. Pisses me off like no other thats for sure, but i love the damn game.
Ruined gaming for me because how good it is
Game file corrupted after 64 hours, and no backup made by the game (and only one save is allowed per character).
fun
I could try to write an essay on how much I love this game and how much I recommend it, but honestly, that's stupid.  It's been forever since a AAA game managed to meet any kind of expectations, and this far surpassed mine.  I'm a huge souls fan. If you love soulsborne games, you'll love this. If you want to try a game in the genre, this is the perfect entry point.  Replayability is near infinite, the world is huge and dense, the art design is gorgeous, the lore is fascinating, the bosses are insanely fun and the music is phenomenal.  This is a truly special and rare type of game that only comes around once in a while. Elden Ring doesn't necessarily innovate or break new ground for the souls series or open world games, but it damn near perfects the formula in my opinion.  I like this game a lot, and I think you will too.
There will never be another game like this. Ever. It deserved all of the awards it won and more. Never has a game left me with such emptiness after I beat it. After the credits rolled I genuinely asked myself "What now?" and the answer was obvious. Play it again.
Yeah just a gorgeous impeccable game overall. So many little things you can easily miss (I used a guide partially), and gameplay that will leave you satisfied and infuriated. Constantly, as a player you will be entering new zones in awe, amazed at the world George. R. R. Martin has helped create, and if you dive deep enough, learn about the lore and stories behind it. A LONG game, and is longer than you think it will be. But SO satisfying and SO good and just GOTY hands down.

nice
luv Margit
good
Beautiful
amazing detail in this game, very well done
I discovered I enjoy pain from this game...
foul tarnished, in search of the elden ring
The Best Souls Experience! Worth the game of the year award!
The Best combat mechanics in a video game.
best
Great game!
Lay these foolish ambitions to rest.
10/10 AGAIN WILL DIE AGAIN
This game is so fire you feel the heat no matter what you're doing or how your doing it.
game sucks lowkey got bored first few hours
gud game
fun
i was ass, then i got good.
if you want to torture yourself, this game is for you. anyways 10/10
Very good game nice open world,and is really challenging
It's good
It's a good game, but if you have an ultrawide monitor the devs hate you and go out of their way to mar the experience for you by placing black bars over any aspect ratio beyond 16:9.  You will have to resort to modding to be able to utilize your entire screen which is just annoying and almost feels spiteful the way it is handled currently. If this 1 thing in particular changed or if you only have a 16:9 display, full marks.
amazing game, so much love put into everything... massive world that's dense with life and story
game of the year
i fucking hate dogs 10/10
The best fromsoft game 
Great for the first few runs but after a while it gets repetitive
one of the most sad yet beautiful games i've played
What a good game but is TOO LONG
My absolute favorite game ever. Warframe became a femboy game that became piss easy so I wanted something else that would fill the void. This was absolutely perfect for that.
One of the best games I` ve ever played. Amazing world to discover and some hard challenges.  Can`t wait for DLC. Highly recommended 
Absolute masterpiece that makes you realize just how pathetic at video games you are.
hello i am making a review on elden ring, if you want to break your screen,keyboard or mouse get this game it is 100 percent rage and 0.0000001 percent fun i hope this helped and have fun adventuring this beautiful gamel.
so far so gud
i don't think i've ever rage quit a game so much in my life   10/10
gud 
It's a great game, everything from the combat, the world, the music and the aesthetic of the locations are completely amazing! If you want a great rpg with action elements, then this is a great choice for you :D
gaem sword death funny haha. Blue wooman hot 
really fun so far 8 hours in and loving it i beat the first demi god now planning on a long level up before i continue 10/10 so far
seek head
bleed op
Lousy story. Lousy game mechanics. No directions on what to do. Waste of time and money.

It's pretty good, yeah
i would play it if it supported ultra wide screen such a waste
Fun!
cool
veri gud
Its Pretty good
fujn 
very cool open world game kept suprising me with content even after i beat the game
Holy fucking shit this is the best game ever made
First off, playing and then let there be positive review!
Love this game so far. Will Update.
veryyy goood\ 
This game was really fun. I've never played a souls game before Elden Ring so i was nervous when getting into it. When I first started i died a lot but as i got further into the game i started to die less. All the bosses felt fair and were fun to fight (except the fire giant fuck that boss). This game has definitely gotten me interested in the souls games. If you are planning on playing this game i do think you should but remember to be persistent and to not quit when it gets hard because when you are finally triumphant it feels great. 10/10 Game
Best game of the year !
great game
GAYUD DAYUM
Very good soul game
you are going to die alot! but thats part of its charm.
Best Souls game by a mile.  Don't be put off by the difficulty.  You can over-level every challenge in the game with patience.
THIS GAME FUCKS
W game. malenia and millicent are fine asl. if you get stuck on any boss its a skill issue tbh
it's ok
shit's just not fun
good game
Just buy it.
i am Malenia, blade of Miquella
Fun game, I like the part where I died.
not sure how anyone gets past most of these enemies
its elden ring neeed I say more?
Yes.
the control on keyboard are so fucking trash
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.  
goty for a reason
 he he game go burrr the lego does not example my oily hat, amen chrome lets gump up they meditableeeems
I paid $120 for me and my 2 cousins to get high blood pressure from Margit.

great gam
one corruped save + 108 hours and i finished melanie and elden beast. im too casual for this shit.
Played for around 20 hours on my first playthrough. Left the game for a little while for no particular reason. Came back to it and started a new character. Was having a really great time. Then the game crashed my computer and upon restarting I was told that my save data was corrupted, with no way to pick up where I left off. I've spent a few hours trying to find a fix with no success. I hope I can find a way to fix it, cause like I said, I was having a lot of fun. To have this taken away from me is very upsetting, and right now I'm not willing to start a new character just to do the same build and get back to where I was. I wish I could be giving this game a good review, but this issue is one I can't overlook.
fort night
game make souls brain go brrr
game of the year
This is possibly game of the century
Fun
Open the game, hear the main menu theme, my case is closed
i don't know what to do ?

As a huge fan of previous fromsoft games i regret not playing Elden Ring earlier. You may look at this games graphics and think its from 2016 or something but when you start playing it instantly encapsulates you and feels a lot better than most of the newer games. Art style and ambiance is fascinating. I regularly find myself just running around and viewing the beatiful scenery without doing anything else. It shows that artists are really the masters of their craft. I also love how fromsoft use music in their games. Its really something magical. Combat is super fluid and satisfying. Open world is amazing, exploring is extremely enjoyable. Weapon variety, ashes of war and sheer number of skills you can get makes the character customization a lot deeper than other fromsoft games and its really fun to try different things on the run. While its probably not so optimal, if you are just exploring every little nook and cranny you'll probably over-level and faceroll the bosses anyway so dont shy and try different things! Haven't finished it yet but i can already tell this will be one of the best games i've ever played.
One of the best what else can you say? I have two different characters with 80+ hours on my xbox and about 3 splitting my 119 hours on the pc. Super fun, runs well, and multiplayer is fun if you can get into it.
I want to go home 
I was never really a soulsborne fan. I played DS1 and DS2 back when they first came out and hated the games. I wasn't accustomed to the playstyle nor the difficulty. Jump forward about a decade, I'm older and more patient. Watched my buddies play the game, figure I would give it a try. Short of 200 hours played, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Visually stunning, fun and challenging combat, a large variety of weapons and builds. I'm on my 4th playthrough and I am going to try to get as much of the lore as I can.   Long story short, if you are a Soulsborne fan, buy Elden Ring. If you are not, come back in a couple of years and try them again. You may find your opinion of the game type has changed.
Great game with a lot of replay value. Also, don't listen to what anyone says; run whatever build you want. Half the time the community is chill but the other half they're bashing you for having fun playing how you like. Dw about it tho do what you want.
gatspel
Very interesting, best Video Game of all time ever!
Fun game, worth the price, Was a big fan of Dark Souls 3 and this is a worthy successor.
Another astounding game from FromSoftware, still finding out cool things about this game. There's so much to discover.
Fun
amazing open world game
Awsome
wd3q3d
Amazing game
one of the best games i've ever played
This game is one of the most adrenaline fueled experiences i've ever had in a video game, whether or not that adrenaline caused me to break the undercarriage of my desk is besides the point.  Best game i've ever played, caused me multiple rage-induced naps and lead to me creating a stronger, more fortified desk for the challenges that will come at it in the future.  10/10
. 
Pretty fun game, kinda easy to 100% achievements but my lawdy if you want to discover EVERYTHING...good luck 10/10 everything
Masterpiece.
Git Gud
I would recommend this game to other players.
Frustration simulator
its good
This game makes me want to die
1st play-through - done, let's go next one! ^_^-V
morgotts toes give me toe porn vibes, plus you get to attack the foreskin duo and giant ed sheeran would recommend to a dyslexic aunt
It is a great game but because of all those crashes i prefer to not play it again. This error have almost one year and the company do not give a damn to fix it. I am not recommending this game, in specially when you see that you have an end tier pc and you still have those crashes. Per total 1 out of 10!
Fun
This game will make you pee blood. Highly Recommend to all gamers of every genre.
pwaaaaaaaaaaaah
This game is the reason that ive attempted suicide 32 times. 11/10 would play again.
I like casual games like this
Good! I love the map, the hidden stuff, and the hitbox's accuracy. But it is just not challenging enough for me. It is too easy and beginner friendly if you know how to play open world without a trackable storyline and quest. You can literally kill anything on a low level with a typical "Arpg chipping hack and dodge" technique.
Extremely expansive open world with good old fromsoftware gameplay. Lots to explore, a ton of diversity in character builds and weapons. You'll be constantly impressed by how the world keeps growing as you progress.
I fell in love with this masterpiece ive died countless times and only beat the game once so far and keep finding new things around this open world... expertly crafted such pain much love.
A-fucking-mazing, 10/10 will keep on playing
Kinda just seems like a huge waste of time and money. All you do is run around and kill stuff, with no real goals other than levelling up to kill bigger stuff. The game gives absolutely ZERO guidance on what to do and is just a complete bore. Feel like you're making progress? Along comes a big guy with a big sword that kills you in 1 hit and you start all the way from the beginning! What fun!
Tato hra je totální master piece  Elden ring byla má první hra od vývojářského studia From Software a musím říct, že na mě studio udělalo obrovský dojem a hry od něj budu hrát i nadále. Ale co podle mě Elden Ring udělalo natolik úžasným?  World: Postupné objevování světa je skvělé a až na výjimky se už od začátku můžeme dostat kamkoliv, což ve hrách vždy rád vidím, ale v Elden Ringu mě to potěšilo ještě více svojí různorodostí, až už travnatý a hornatý Lim Grave, pustý a děsivý Caelid, jezernatá Liurnia či jednoduše nádherná Siofra. Všechno to jsou opravdu krásně vybudované a obsahem narvané lokace ,u kterých se vám oči ani prsty nudit nebudou. Každá nabízí své unikátní nepřátele i atmosféru, která by se dala krájet. Jak rád bych opět zažil ten pocit co jsem měl při prvním spuštění. Ten pocit po touze objevovat a prozkoumat ten svět, který se předemnou právě otevřel do posledního koutku. A že má co nabídnout. I po spuštění NG+ se mi podařilo najít lokace o jejichž existenci jsem do teď neměl ani páru. K lokacím mám jen jednu jedinou výtku a to směrem k Weeping Peninsula, která toho dle mého nemá zas tolik co nabídnout, ale zase nechci říkat, že by se jednalo o něco špatného.  Gameplay: Postava je krásně responzivní, reaguje přesně jak klikám a ani jednou se mi nestalo, že by opravdu dělal něco co sem nechtěl. U každého špatného rollu jsem věděl, že je to má chyba, stejně tak u každého pádu při platformové pasáži. Možná ovládání Torrenta je trochu prkené. Ovládání v soubojích je jednoduché na pochopení, příjemné a na ovládání. Ještě bych chtěl vypíchnout jak hra přistupuje k questům. Žádně question marky, které mi ukazují kam mám jít. Nic takového v Elden Ringu nenajdete. Sice možná některé questy budete procházet dle návodů na Wiki/YTB, ale to mi vůbec nevadilo. Naopak mě to těšilo tím jak hra není zbytečně zahlcená a není tam nic zbytečně navíc. Dále bych chtěl zmínit summons, kterých je ve hře opravdu dost. Postupem času odemykáte lepší. Summons můžete získat u traderů nebo z bossů. Které si pak vylepšujete stejně jako zbraně.  Příběh: Osobně bych řekl, že studiem loru jsem strávil ještě víc času než na hře samotné. Propracovaná historie a malinkaté detaily, které ho doplňují, mě uchvátili více jak jakákoliv fantasy kniha či film co jsem kdy viděl. George Raymond Richard Martin odvedl při tvorbě tohoto světa naprosto fenomenální práci. Dobrá práce Georgi  Finální verdikt: I přes to, že bych o Elden Ringu byl schopen mluvit dlouhé hodiny, udělám to jak stručně jen můžu: 11/10 +příběh/Lore +mechanika hry +prostředí +grafika +soundtracks ... Užijte si tento mistrovský kousek
I smashed a keyboard into 2 
Roll is poorly optimized and you get caught frequently mid roll. roll also takes a couple seconds before actually coming out. Ds3 is better still. I like the graphics and quests and world map and items of elden ring. but not the actual combat of bosses and such. horribly balanced. poorly optimized all of the work went into the graphics and map design. Which is fair because people want to see a good looking game, but you should at some measure put more effort into the balancing of weapons and skills, etc. It makes a really big difference when you have a good game and good mechanics and a good game with bad mechanics. At least in ds3 when I roll I actually negate damage because of the invincibility frames actually existing. This game isn't challenging. Its forced difficulty. Don't let my negative review stop you though, its overall a good game. It just doesn't have a polished combat system like ds3, I enjoy the ds3 mechanics because I played a lot of ds3 on Xbox so this is my biased opinion.
If you want to play multiplayer don't bother, I didn't know Co-op dictates only fighting bosses, which I could refund this piece of crap.
Maybe the best video game I've ever played. That's it.  That's the review.
Best game or at least best Open world game i have ever played <3

Amazing. Feels like an infinite build of classes and weapon combinations. Great story and lore.
If you have played other Fromsoft games - you already know what to expect. More or less same formula, just way, way better.  If you are not a "souls" fan, but like the look of this game, I would suggest:  1) Ignore the willy waving macho BS of the online fanboys.  2) Play offline. I have no desire to become part of some 16 year old's fantasy, and I find that there is more than enough to keep one interested in single player mode.  3) If you find the game difficult, there are mods for the PC version that can help you. (See points 1 and 2).  4) There are several really good walk through guides on YouTube to help you avoid walking around aimlessly :-)
It's alright.
its gooood

One of the best games I've ever played, It's difficult so know you will die a lot. But there is nothing better than that feeling of overcoming that difficult challenge. I've beaten the game 3 times and still haven't done everything, there is so much to do and it is a super fun game to play. Totally recommend 10/10
gfdsa
Honestly one of the best games ive played in too long. It's really a one of a kind type of game with breath-taking visuals and addicting gameplay. There hasnt been a game i would call "my favorite" for awhile now, but this one takes the cake.  highly recommend seamless coop mod with it! 
purrfect 
One of the best games of all time!
Elden Ring Makes me Elden Hard. get d game B-cause you will have a nice time.
game is bullshit honestly so fucking shit even after grinding for fucking hours u get one shot by a fucking walking tree with herpes
she elden on my ring til i
i suck
Games great, I got bored of it quickly but I realized its cause I looked so much stuff up to help me get through or get builds I want instead of just playing the game and finding secrets myself. Don't do what I did until you beat the game for the first time and it'll be magnificent. 10/10
i like 
try finger
First souls game. Took some time to get used to the action i-frames. Amazing exploration experience; catacombs and dungeons may get repetitive though. Wide arsenal of weapons and spells to suit your choice of play. I think I died more from falling off cliffs due to Torrent than from enemies. Solid 10.
QuantumTV is maidenless
nice
Why always review?
best game and better than gow
good 
fvcking love it
You will feel like you are in another world........of death....but its a cool world, still cool
Yes it’s that good
My first ever FromSoft game!! It's such a masterpiece, long since an ending of a game had made me this satisfied. It truly deserves the GOTY award of 2022!
Masterpiece.
Malenia the severed is the best boss
absolutely amazing! I don't really like solo player games but with this game it can be challenging and if you truly need help you can summon your friends def worth getting!
Really fun, If your struggling don't be afraid to watch guides
If u want a game where every boss fells like ur on the receiving end of a gay threesome then this is the game for u 10/10 would recomend
i have been playing it for a while and i've loved it the hardest best game i've played
Еле домучил. В душе добротная, но в действительности на каждую бочку мёда тут приходится ложна говна, что даже в такой пропорции даёт известный результат.
easy game if u think about it
Its a really really fun game as i have beat the game 3 times now going on to journey 3 and i love just doing diffrent endings eachtime as it keeps me engajed if yk what i mean. other than that  graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 quests 6.5/10 bosses 5/10 all double bosses godskin duo for example arent good bc there both long range, fast, and there moves are just annoying and they never switch it up in total i give it a 9.5/10 bc it still a really good game
tarro
malenia hard
it won game of the year for a reason
Cant be assed to review the game but was good overall beat it 4 times in a day i might need help  
Don't quite understand the hype for this, the story makes no sense and provides zero motivation to progress. For a narrative-free game of pattern recognition allow me to recommend Simon, instead.
Boring grind. It looks nice and story seems interesting but it gets boring and repetetive in a while.
beautifal
great game 
Great! Fair game of the year award!
I have enjoyed every minute so far of playing this game.

I only cried 50 times but I eventually beat it. My first souls games I beat too.
Score: 8/10  Solid game, just not my type. I don't really enjoy Souls-like games and I'm jealous of people who actually do. I get it, you try and try and try and kill the boss and that satisfaction is everything but to me it's not enough to beat all the frustration I have during playing the game.  The game itself is beautiful, great animations, bosses, creatures and the environment is stunning. The only thing that I didn't like is that character feels tooo slow most of the time, idk how to explain it. Feels like when I tap on my controller it has a delay and character does it after 1-2 seconds. Maybe it's supposed to be like that but made me frustrated.  If you love souls-like games you'll definitely enjoy this one, one of the best if not the best in it's genre. Who knows? Maybe I'll get back to it at some point but for now I just can't, I prefer to spend my time in something relaxing.
I LOVE UNDERTIME SLOPPER
10/10 In the beginning this game will tell you to return this and buy something else DON'T, keep trying and keep exploring watch YT videos to better understand the game and eventually you'll be the elden lord like so many of us tarnished. GLORY TO THE GOLDEN ORDER
Cosplayed as Sauron, got wrecked by a frog-face mob.

It wouldn't be half as difficult if it wasn't for the abysmal controls. Half the time you will die because you're trying to select a specific potion/spell/item. The other half you die because the target lock doesn't pick up on the enemy even though they're in full view. I guess it's a half-baked console port.
roll
that's game is super good
amazing game
It's worth the time, give it a try and you won't regret it
best game ever!!!!!!!!!!
great game,  a complete upgrade version of dark souls
You know all about it by now...
huge game..can get a bit messy at times but well worth the effort
this game is kinda nutty, me like
yes
this game gives me suicidal thoughts 10/10
Excellent game
The plan is simple. Reuse everything as much as you want to. Use shit ton of things from previous games, just so they can think that it's just a refference and nostalgia. If the boss is easy, add another one or make him faster, so they won't have a time to heal. Oh, and fuck up the code so some of the walls can be broken if they hit it like 70 times and call it a feature :D  Enjoyed it and will play it again for sure. Lot of things to do and a lot of playstyles to choose from. Boring endings and seemed kinda rushed by the end, but overall had a great experience.   Oh, and don't you dare to lose a connection to internet, cause it will take you back to menu (happened just seconds before killing an annoying boss).
Really immersive and entertaining
game nhu c*c <3
Pretty good stuff.
I didnt expet that the game would be this amazing, really a must play.
GOTY for a reason, just buy it
i killed a kid and got away with it
Didint like souls at all but this one rocks
My favorite dog finding simulator
es lo mas hermoso que jugue en mi vida
what can i say that hasnt already been said... best gaame of the year, perhaps of the decade
The world building is amazing
naist
Fantastic game. Well worth the price.
Nice game. Go for it if you wanna break your controllers and hate yourself for buying this game.
game good  drop rate BAD  8 outta 10
Cliff ahead  Butt Hole
This game is almost unplayable, took me 2 hours and countless reset to kill the "tutorial boss". Definitely recommend it >:T
GOTY
One, if not the best, gaming experiences you can have. My elden Lord, thy be amazing.
goated game
Simply Awesome
The game that keeps on giving.
Great Game
Induces a masochist urge to beat the boss without leveling up. 10/10 I recommend the lands between.
idk good game
I sold my liver for this, it better be worth it
- Disgusting storytelling. - Terribly boring open world after the "graveyard" location. - literally a couple of unique bosses.  But still a gem!
yes
amazing game
its ok, feels a bit outdated mechanically,  would only buy on big sale
I want to hurt myself when I play this game
very gug
I was a bit late to the party, I started playing about 2 weeks ago and I am roughly 40 hours into my save at the moment, so about 40% through the game.   A few notes about the cons.  1. KB+M is unplayable you need a controller 2. You may need a beefy computer to play this smoothly at 2K resolution, and you may get stutters even still  Now for the pros.  1. Easily the best single player game I have ever played 2. Absolutely incredible 3. Holy s**t
Worthy GoTY

this is the best game ive ever played!
Hands down, undoubtedly the game of the year. The sheer scope and grandeur of the game, along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched - among the very best that games have to offer.
The experience is awful on mouse and keyboard but on controller its a masterpiece.
big
It's Skyrim, but with Dark Souls combat. Absolute 10/10.
Its okay I guess
Malenia is too easy she needs to be buffed. Serious balance issue on FromSofts part so I can't recommend this game In good faith.
Elden Ring 2 when?
sensational
i die

best game ive ever played
Its easier then Bloodborne
First play Dark Souls then play Elden Ring
Great!!!!
its ok
Amazing open world souls game, vast map and enemy types, insane amounts of playstyles from weapons to spells. Overall a breathtaking experience!
Perfect game for my 14 month-old son.
Best Game Ever
good game
yes
Best game I've played in years, not many things have been able to hold my attention like Elden Ring.  About to start my fourth play through and still feeling hooked.
this game is buggy as hell, caps at 60fps, and is insanely inaccessible. dogshit.
bussin
Make me want to commit the fourth Great Reich 
best game ever too easy don't play for challenge
Challenging, but fair. Giant swords. Make friends with earthenware. What more could you ask for??
live, die, repeat, simulator
Open World Dark Souls
Amazing game, I'm quite in love with it. I'm editing this review later on into a proper one, but I'm leaving a negative review because Bandai is at it again trying to straight up rob people with their prices in south america.  There's no excuse for these prices, since they can still load their pockets from people who can actually pay for them in first world countries, so I'm putting negatives on every game that updates prices to unreasonable amounts in a market that actually allows for regionalization.  And for all my south american friends out there who can't pay for it: Just play the Jack Sparrow version, don't let them get away with it ;)
Incredible game.
This is my first true FromSoft game. I own DarkSouls 3, but didn't get invested into it until right before playing this game at the same time as my friends. My friends and I decided to play this game without looking anything up on the internet for help. I beat the final boss and have started to look things up for the first time. This is a very fun game when playing with the correct attitude. You die a lot, it's part of the game. You sacrifice your life to learn something new, you purposefully lose your runes during the next attempt at the boss so they don't distract you the next several attempts at beating it, you try, try, try again, then tweak setups before trying more. I really have enjoyed playing this game, and I hope to enjoy playing it more now that I can learn things from others online.   As a side note: I have no idea what just happened plot wise... game is pretty vague in the plot department if you don't know where/how to pay attention.
Amazing, gorgeous game
yes 
Fun Game check  Challenging game check worth the money check good game play check  final verdict 9/10 very happy with my purchase!
In this game you learn how to suffer, break shit, cry, and worship the beautiful ass graphics.  Oh yeah don't forget dog=turtle=god
pretty mid tbh
Mhmm yumyum
Great game lots of replay ability, had fun making a lot of different builds, W game tbh
Highly recommend specially if you are tired of the W key hack and slash games we always seem to get.   Yea plenty of hard fights in here but when you win it feels freakin great. on top of that this is the first game where exploring feels like your doing something. just when you think they will get lazy and just toss some junk in the corner of the map you end up 2 hrs dead into content and the views never stop.      Oddly Melania was easy to beat but the Crucible Knight Duo and Malikeith or what ever his name is took me hrs . my attention span is hella low and ive pulled 231 hrs and still going
No 
I found a ring on the floor and it looks pretty old, I called it the elden ring because it's an elder, and that's what elden ring is, probably, I haven't played it
KILL YOUSELVES FROMSOFT PUTAAS WWHY DO YOU HATE MAKING A FUN GGAME
just finished my 3rd playthrough and the 100% achievement.  well deserved GOTY, and one of my all time favs for sure. easiest FromSoftware game in my opinion, but one of their best in terms of story, boss design, and endings.  hopefully one day i can run bloodborne on pc and experience that gem, but for now this is one i'll stick with for a while :)
It does work amazing, but for whatever reason it just crashing and crashing on me after fixing my pc, and it start getting worse for me to not play it at all. I hope you can fix this issue and such. it's making the game unplayable for me. so yeah, it's just non serious issue report, I just want the game to be fix
praise this message!  then try fingers  game
Not a perfect game, just a very good game.
best ever 
Im not going to say its a bad game but it is a dissapointment, the open world format weighs down what could have been an spectacular 50 hour experience that would be laser focused, and instead it recycles content and makes it feel like a slog you just want to get done with by the end.  While Dark Souls will leave you wanting more, Elden Ring will have you questioning when does it stop
The beauty and challenge of the game speaks for itself. It can be very difficult, but that just makes it all the more rewarding. Play it. If you don't hate it within the first hour (enough time for a full refund) then you never will and you won't regret it.
dog!
My overall take: Wow. Where to even start. This is the first souls game I have ever played. I come from playing games like Destiny 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Mass Effect, etc. Sometime the games being "hard". I did not know what hard was until I played this game. Nor have I ever had this much of challenge for a game. Other games are somewhat challenging, but this one tests your skills. Some of you will be slightly frustrated, some angry, and a select few give up the game when you keep trying to kill the sentinel at the starting area. But those who don't you will find yourself comparing other games to this game. Once you complete elden ring, every game you play after this will be a cake walk. This is a fantastic game. The world is so large with all sorts of enemies and items littered around the area. You actually have an incentive to explore in order to face the next boss. None of the quests are pointless skinned objectives. Every level up and item you get will bring you a step closer to becoming lord.   Aspects: The parts that relieve you from the frustration is the messages on the ground. They can be helpful, but sometimes they can be funny and humorous. Read them when you have the chance. The number of main quests in this game aside from the linear story, are all meaningful and have purpose. The Items depending on your combat style will help you in your progress. Find Bell items to help get more items to level up your weapons. Explore the world. You spend plenty of time leveling up to get to the next boss. You might as well explore.   The World:  This game shows that art style is supreme when presenting a game. It may not be bringing your console or pc to its knees because of its graphics, but it beautiful in its own unique way. There will be times you just stop to admire how beautiful the game is. The world is so big. I didn't realize there was an underground area until mid way through my playthrough. There is so much in this world. You can spend hundreds of hours and you will never see all of it.   Combat:  Skill is everything. Be mindful and strategic. You can spam if you want but be strategic about it. Find the way you like to fight at the beginning of the game and not further in. I learned using a regular axe of the most the way until midway then I switched weapon type and took some time to learn. Long story short find the way you like to fight and stick with it, while improving your skills.   End Review:   I have never played a game that required this much skill. I was frustrated many times, but when you beat a boss it is so rewarding and feels great. I hope you all enjoy the journey to become the Elden Lord.
good game
Reading reviews is wasting time you could be playing
Can be very unfair but it makes up for it in exploration and good boss fights
111 hours and I'm not recommending it. Good God.  Pros: Level design, character design, environment art, music: all of these are top-tier and will keep you going throughout a very long journey.  Cons: People confuse obfuscation with mystery and bad UX with challenge. To complete this game, you will have to consult a wiki. Not because it is hard (which it is) but because they do very little to tell you where your objectives are. Perhaps they expect you to endlessly wander around the world in hopes you bump into that NPC again. If they put them on the critical path line, maybe that would happen but it is often just in a random spot. That isn't serendipity; it's just being opaque. Maybe the nonsense story would make a bit of sense if information was organized or if there was a basic quest tracker. I don't need a bunch of UI elements to tell me exactly where something is, just try and respect the player a little bit. Did you know that you essentially have to upgrade HP more than any other stat or you will be one-shotted by nearly everything in the game? Would be nice to know, especially since you can only recast your stats halfway-ish through the game.  Speaking of respecting the player, if you are going to be tough as nails, you have to be spotlessly bug free. Unfortunately, attacks go through solid objects at random and frame drops will eat your lunch at the worst possible times. There's little joy when you eventually succeed; just relief that an annoying element is done. Luckily, you can often beat bosses by tricking the AI or leveraging a bug in the environment so I guess two can play at that game.   And who decided that this game where the character rightly feels like he is wearing forty pounds of armor should be a platformer?   I'm happy I roughed my way through it, but I can't see myself recommending it to anyone. It's an interesting game, but not what the incredibly toxic community exalts it as. It's a bleak game with a few truly exquisite moments outweighed by a preponderance of slog. And now I'm finally free of it.
Awful terrible dogshit linear endgame with terrible final bosses
best souls game i ever play, i recommend this game to any gamer that wants a challenge  
Game of the year for sure.
the game is hard
A Masterpiece in game design, world building and story telling.   Gives you more than enough tools to succeed but doesn't need to hold your hand.   With atmosphere and tension thick enough to cut with a knife this game is one for the all time greats.
:er_wave:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
yay
Great game. First souls gamer and really enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Also it it great to play with friends.

yes
Elden Ring is a Challenging yet rewarding experience as you traverse through large open world landscapes permeating with enemies and bosses of all different shapes, sizes and attack styles. The game (much like the soulsbourne series in general) is an excellent personification of life itself. Focusing on a format where through your many struggles and setbacks, if you learn from your mistakes and persevere, you will prevail. Their are multiple different classes to choose that allow you to play the game how you see fit, so their is no right or wrong way to play and is purely up to player on how best to approach a situation and to embrace or strategise your strengths and weaknesses. The game is also very well polished (a rarity in modern gaming) with clear forethought in its design, very minimal bugs were present in my play through and the combat seems very well balanced. The story is conveyed mostly through lore, requiring the player to research the details of the characters and they're history, ambitions & goals to create a better understand of the world. Some may be disappointed in its lack of presence but personally this works in favour of the game, as its there if you are interested to learn, and if you're not then just carry on and it won't matter (Radahn has the best backstory btw). needless to say I adore Elden Ring and look forward to seeing more from Fromsoftware :)  tl;dr Overall Elden Ring is easily the best way to get into the Soulsbourne series of games, its challenging yet rewarding, has fairly balanced combat, the open world is mesmerising, extensive lore. their is lots to love about this game   10/10   GOTY for 2022
First time going into a dark souls like game not really knowing what to expect but boy did this game blow my mind out of the waters. Great game. Great setting. Great story :)
i guess its ok
The Graphics Are dogsh*t
The same creators of Ghibli Studio's Howl's Moving Mausoleum and My Invader Totoro by Miyazaki himself.
Best game i've played
THIS GAME IS FIRE, just try it
GAME OF THE YEAR BOYYY!
play elden ring
Amazing game. Fromsoft has outdone themselves majorly. 103 hours in the game about to be done with my second ending. AMAZING. finding bosses i never found in the first play through.

Fun game fun sometimes
Could this be the Elden Ring?
No Cant' destroyt
Best game ever
The game is hard, no joke, but the satisfaction of beating a hard boss and the breath taking open world makes the game an incredible experience, I do not regret playing and finishing the game a single bit.
stars of ruin go brrrr
Big Bonk! Best Strategy!
breath of the wild sucks ass
i love it 
"Put these foolish ambitions to rest."
piece of art truly
Best exploration game in years, a masterpiece of the genre. Tons of completely original environments with gorgeous views and unique twists. Combat is fine i guess.
Unique in a good way--players with a keen eye for detail will appreciate the sheer depth of the world.
THE ELDEN RING! THE ELDEN RING IS REEEAL
Fire 
Best game ever

10/10
sword gaem
The only thing I can compare playing Elden Ring for the first time to is the very first time I every played Skyrim. All of that wonder, excitement, possibility, and potential. This game is magical and everyone should give it a try.
it good
its a genuinely great game, though it can be very difficult at times.
very good game 10/10
goos shit
thats what im saying
You all know this is one of the best games of all time, enough said. Sure it's not perfect but it's very fun. If you rage quit easily first of all big L second don't play this game bozo.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
One of the best gaming experience I've ever had.  10/10
BEST GAME
game is good but it makes me irrationally angry so im giving it a thumbs down anyway
Good game, me like
I thought I wouldn't like it. silly old me. 
very hard game
w graphics
ELDEN RING, O ELDEN RING
what the fuck
This is the worst FromSoft game I have ever played, and the second worst Soulslike behind Salt and Sanctuary.  I am so disappointed.  Moving to an open world has absolutely killed all joy, all tension, all skill and hardship that defined the Souls series. I am completely alone in a bland, empty world with no noteworthy npcs, copy pasted dungeons, the ability to completely invalidate entire sections of the map by accidentally leveling up (you know, playing the game) or just spawning a summon that dumpsters any boss.  Open world worked in the Witcher because it had a story, and characters to make the world feel alive or at least give you a purpose for what you are doing.  Not to mention that it looked and played far better with better quality of life inclusions.  Riding a horse sucks, scanning the map so you don't miss important items or entire NPC questlines sucks.  Enemy design is a joke where they will literally have a seizure if you hit them too much.  You can't compare shop items to ones equipped because this game was apparently designed in 1997.  FromSoft tried to shove a square peg into a triangular hole and failed miserably.  If the next game is this sloppy I don't see a future for FromSoft other than a dead company or an Activisionesque shit pusher.
Good Game
my very first souls game and i love it. its everything i expected and more.
Died 100m times, would die 100m times more
very punishing
Se vc joga PES, FIFA ou FORZA, esse é o jogo pra você.
Maidenless...
i liked mostly everything... thas iiiiit
perfection 
Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild, and adds up to be better than both.
gud 
behold Dog
game is col but you never see family again
Elden Bling
A challenging but balanced experience.
This game is complete BS. I've beaten it four times. One of the best games I've ever played.
The witch lady has 4 hands. 10/10
I bought this game only for The Loathsome Dung Eater
I've never left a review for any game ever. I'm 30+ so I've been playing games for decades. This game has got me.
:(
Overall absolutely gorgeous game. Graphics are beautiful. Game play is amazing. This is one of the only games I've beat and have gone around for a second and third run. There is always new stuff to discover.
:D
Fun, characters are customize able and you are not really locked in to the quest, you can roam around and make yourself OP prior to doing the quest and boss fights
Excellent game, very challenging but beautiful work by the game designers.
this game is a great game especially if it is your first experience with a souls like game. i have enjoyed this game and have 100% it because it is an amazing game
You can pet the dog
fire thats all ill say
Was maidenless and couldn't try tongue but whole
good game
i'm very new to elden ring (this is my first fromsoft game!) so i'm still getting destroyed by most enemies and making mistakes as i learn the game, but even with the many deaths i've had so far i've been having so much fun! there's lots to do here as the open world is incredibly expansive, the animation looks great, and the ost is a banger.
I didn't play any of the souls games prior to this, but heard good reviews from this so tried it. And even in the first few minutes I got bored, the graphics felt cheap to me like pubg for some reason and the controls weird (Who jumps with F instead of space and selects OK with E and back with Q?).   But as I played just 30 mins more the next day and faced my first boss it kicked off, I started to see what it was about. There is nothing more satisfying than failing a boss multiple times, getting stronger and more skilled and finally beating it after an hour. I saw the attention to detail in the story lines, the beauty of certain cut scenes and scenic points, and the sheer size of the map to explore.   And don't forget the amount of freedom the game offers you. You can customise your character and it's combat style to the smallest detail. And it does not have to stay that way, I changed from a tank class to a sorcerer in just a matter of minutes because I enjoyed that style more. You are not constantly reminded of quests you accepted. So you have to remember which made me form a bond with those characters by making them the focus instead of just completing to get items. I've watched some of the lore people have got on youtube to expand my knowledge of this world even more. And the story has multiple endings (as I've heard) from the choices you make. An RPG in its truest essence.  I can now truly see the love and effort the developers put into this game, and see it as a form of art and an experience worth the time and money. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, one of my best by far.
This game is very goated and red pilled
Cool
DOG go quack.
it good
Worst gaem ever.

10/10
This review is written from a (perspective) run I tried to do with a standard classic greatsword playthru with no summons, incarnation,passive buildups which open up my eyes on ER flaws a lot more:    The Main Bosses aka the Legendary Bosses that you are required to beat are honestly not that fun or satisfying.  It seem like they all share the same type of behaviour:  -spam every attack possible with little to no cooldown in-between each attack and ability.  -leave a 0.5 second window for the player to both react on and deal damage in -Evade if the player is close to them for more then 2 seconds. -have a back/tail attack if you manage to out-maneuver them and strike from behind. -Still being able to instantly kill you even with 60+ Vigor.   And even when you manage to outplay them they will find a way to punish you. Out of all main bosses that I played against the only ones that was fun more me was Godfrey and Rykard.  The mid to late game bosses are some of the most dull and annoying encounters as well:  Radahn: Honestly not the worst but just feel like a chore if anything. Draconic Tree sentinel: I mean its already a tree sentinel reskin with just some added abilites that they spam even more with. Morgott: Spam and very small attack windows if you try to avoid damage. Fire giant: ridiculous large arena and tanky HP. You are not even fighting a boss, just its feet.  God skin duo: Reskin fight of the Godskins noble but you have to fight 2 instead of just 1 and you need to kill both of them twice.  Makelith. Spam.  There is to much waiting and too little combat cause of all the spam attacks and Evades.  This also leaves a lot of weapon types unviable for PVE cause of how slow you attack with them. By the time you started your swing animation with something like a colossal sword the boss could already gotten 5 hits on you.    I am not saying its impossible to beat them with standard "balanced true-soul experience gameplay" builds But its not fun   Fromsoftware balanced the game way to much around co-op and arcane/int/ability builds it indirectly nerfed standard sword and no-abilites meele gameplay which is a bummer.  On my first playthrough all I used was a katana with bleed buildup and scarlet rot dragon ability and it was pretty much ggs.  +Game is still really fun +there is so much to do +Good replayability  +Fun and intresting side quests as well side quest bosses +tons of different builds and playstyles you can do and test out (even if some of them are straight up busted or really underwhelming without specific items)   In the end of the day ER is primarily a RPG game so it make sense to a degree the way its balanced and designed  If you however want something that offer a more linear and rewarding basic melee gameplay you should probably look into DS3 or Sekiro.  
Easily the best Zelda game since Ocarina of Time.
Best game of all time.  Nothing else needs to be said.
ok
WOW! This game is such a great title. I have never been a great souls gamer but this title makes it easy for anyone to pick this up and have a blast. Everything is S-Tier, from the environment to gameplay, original score to narrative. I have had a fantastic time in my 8 plus run-throughs of the game. Rise now ye tarnished. Get this game and be Maidenless no more.
Dark souls
It's the best game I've played in a long, long time. Quite possibly my favorite. And I certainly wouldn't say it is a perfect game, but it is as close as I have seen a game come to being perfect in a long time. The only things I really don't like about the game are the way the story/lore are presented, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Amazing weapons and gear, stellar combat, a beautiful world and soundtrack. I cannot recommend this game enough.
There are four more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.
FUN EARLY / MID GAME . LATE GAME SUCKS SO BAD. TONS OF REPLAY VALUE
it good ir woukld gety
peak.
pve gud pvp doo doo trash
First souls game, love it.
First time souls player and i absolutely loved Elden Ring! bought it on release because of a friends recommendation and i still come back to it over 230 hours in game to mess around with new builds and hunt down bosses i havent found yet. There are some steep increases in difficulty throughout the campaign but you are always free to go back and explore earlier zones, leveling up and finding new weapons/learning new skills. This may be my favorite RPG of all time!
This game is great. RPG fanatics should definitely play this game.
I will make Jar-Awareness Month a thing in honor of my potty fellers that have died in the creation of this Elden Ring Review Game good me like   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At0QHzn8wQc
if you have a short temper or are bad at games don't buy it, but it is an amazing game.
just dodge lol
sTAB STAB STAB die  respawn STAB STAB STAB
pretty easy
One of the best games I've ever played and I've played allot of games! Other open world RPG devs can learn allot from this game. It constantly felt fresh and interesting. The art alone is more than enough reason to play the game.
gud
I cannot bring anything new to the table. Everything that must be said, has been. This is an awesome game but it does feel unfair sometimes when it comes to balancing. I also would love to see more attention being poured into bows, crossbows, and thrown weapons.
It's an OK game but unfortunately I found it EXTREMELY grindy. As a relative newbie to the souls games, having only played some early stages of Sekiro when visiting a friend, I didn't quite know what to expect. The online debate didn't miss me so the mantra of "tough but fair" was definitely familiar. Bulletpoints: - the combat is entertaining but unfortunately my reflexes aren't as sharp as they used to be so I can't say I found it particularly enjoyable. It ultimately relies way too much on grind to compensate for slower than average response times. While I understand the logic of git gud and I did invest a lot of time into the game in the end the mechanic of farming plebs for level up points un-engaging. Even if I ultimately bailed, the purist are right about no difficulty slider, and the amount of time i sunk into it shows that the gameplay loop is more than good enough. - the story is meh, pretentious drivel or maybe it's just not for me. - the atmosphere works but not really something to write home about. It wasn't one of those things that had me giddy to open the game again, but maybe it's just that dreary isn't something I search for in my free time.  By the time I realized killing dragons wasn't triggering a spark of emotion I had to accept that it was time to stop. Not recommending the game only because 60$ for a game not worth finishing that also relies a lot on fast reflexes and persistence seems a bit steep. Felt the same with Sekiro when I had to kill 10 mobs covertly before I could attempt the larger boss, Doing it once was exciting, but by the time I beat the boss, it was like a 3-4 minute chore I have to do before I was allowed to actually enjoy the game.
ye
Big Dark Souls
We`re way too lucky that we live in the same time as Hidetaka Miyazaki and masterpieces like ELDEN RING. I also need help, this game is so good that i can`t stop playing it
3 часа траил Радана. Спекнул билд. Убил за 1 трай
still no maidens
rykard's voice acting
first ds game i played loved it wish i could play it again for the first time
Besides some stutter and 60fps cap, it's perfect.
Most fun I've had in an open world RPG.
good game, hard game yes but good game
239 Hours in and I cannot get enough of this game. One of the best games I have ever played
yes
Amazing
i have played this game multiple time on the ps5 but bought it on my new pc more for mod's. the game offer's much different game path's which i enjoy and still have a few to play but life i geuss. i would give my whole fortune to play this game for the first time again.
"Try jumping" *20 bloodstains surrounding the message*

Thank God I'm unemployed
absolute masterpiece, 11/10 chocolate bars. simply put, easily has exceeded my expectations. cant wait for possible dlc and new content
This game is MASSIVE and beautiful, even 70 hours in, I'm still finding new things in areas I've been to multiple times. The atmosphere is rich and the landscape is beautiful  to just stand around and look at. Just make sure there isn't anything behind you.
I can't believe it took me this long to play this. Such an incredible game. Completely enthralling! Such a refreshing evolution of this genre!
I hate this game but you should play it for sure
i wna kms
define the word. Fucking amazing The answer is elden ring
FromSoftware's most ambitious project to date is also their absolute best. This is their first open world game, yet it is easily the best open world out of any game thus far. Elden ring is a landmark achievement not only for FromSoftware, but for gaming as a whole. It easily became my #1 favorite game, with 113 hours I am still learning about and discovering this massive world chalk full of content. Absolutely worth the buy.
Other than a few bosses with enraging hit boxes or linear designs, this is an amazing game worth playing
master peace 
nice
An Absolute Masterpiece
game hard but maybe level and not hard? NO. Game still hard and make damage that larger than red bar so die. Haha somber stone. Oh no only 8?  I die and not runes have. gone. gone. gone. sometimes i wish i stayed in food service.
I will sneak behind enemies lock on then use a light attack and miss this game is trash
good game 8/10, would recommend P.S. Melania is overhyped, easy boss

10/10  Pros: •	Perfect visual and music •	Spectacular combination of open-world with traditional Soulsborne locations •	Challenging and rewarding combat •	Quests require exploration Cons: •	Boss AI frequently gets stuck •	Lots of repetitive bosses •	Some attacks and combos are almost impossible to evade •	Ping in PVP is frustrating •	Sometimes crashes  Summary: Even hearing people complaining that the game is a Dark Souls 4, I can simply say that it is not just a Dark Souls 4. It’s the Dark Souls 4 in open-world, with plot easier to grasp and a combination of the best features and mechanics from previous games. Generally, its not as perfect as DSIII, but taking into consideration me playing the former years after release, and this game just after the first day patch, after some updates it would receive a 10/10. 
It's pretty great, I would recommend to anyone looking for a challenging RPG.
yuh
:)
Well deserved goty.

Makes you feel like a kid playing video games for the first time. The world is vast and strange, exploring it is exciting and scary at the same time. The graphics and music are amazing. Combat is relatively easy to understand but hard to execute well, after a while you realize how much variety there is and it will drive you to explore new ways of playing.   It is an adventure game with some of the best combat systems out there. There is not an easy to follow story, you will piece things together as you play. The more you pay attention and search for it, the more you will understand and enjoy the lore. You don't have to though, the game is amazing however you choose to enjoy it.
10/10
Amazing game with beautiful atmosphere and enormous world to explore. Highly recommend to any RPG fans. There are elements in the game that allow an easier difficulty as well if needed.
3 February :Overrated sh*t Update: I changed my mind, it's the best game ever
It's been a while since I invest much of my time in playing video games. Elden Ring takes me back into playing and whoops...136 hours and still playing... Game of the year, well deserved!
I dont understand the hype on this unfinished product. The only way you can play with friends is though a buggy mod bc the devs wanted you to spend days building a character and have the chance for no one to see your hard work. There's no diversity in the weapons you unlock. No god rolls or anything, just the basic same crap as the next guy. The game feels lazy and cheap, but is heavily glorified by ppl for some reason. I'd rather play path of exiles than this and POE is free. Elder Scrolls Online is way better than Elden Ring imo. Wish I could return it. Beat the story with the bosses and you don't unlock anything cool to expand the depth of the game. You just start over and get more materials from your kills and eventually the stronger you become, but you have to play through the same crap to get there. Not a fan at all.
ok game
Love it
good game
Another epic game from software just awesome
Its ok
pretty good
this game is awesome guys

This was my first venture into the Souls games. I wish I never played it...because I CAN'T STOP playing Souls games now.  It ruined my life because I spend all my free time engaging in this beautiful, dark, and twisted world. When I'm not playing Elden Ring, I'm playing Sekiro or Dark Souls 3.  Just purchased Bloodborne too.  Do not play this game...it's too much fun and you won't be able to stop.
damm good fun to play
Un joc puternic dezvoltat, care mi-a schimbat viata.
I used an item to tell Malenia she was beautiful and she ran me through. 10/10
I was somewhat reluctant about diving into this game due to the reputation of FromSoftware's games being really hard. My only regret now is not getting it sooner, it is simply fantastic and ticks all the right boxes for me.
best game for salt, people hate you for playing well  no joke love souls games.
Both hands required
AmEzInG gAeM
This is by far one of the best games I've ever played. To people who play lots of games you will really enjoy this. But this game is difficult with a large open world. So newer players to souls like and games in general may find it quite overwhelming. Amazing bosses, world, scale and music. 10/10
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
Best Open World Game
yes
almost broke my controller i would recommend 5/5
For fans of the Demon's Greathammer from DS1, that's now called "Prelates Inferno Crozier." Good bonking to you.
you have no right, O, you have no right furthermore, you have no right, O, you have no right.
normik😊
Game of the year for a reason, just wait for the DLC to arrive! The game starts big, then gets bigger, then omg its huge
It is Game Of The Year 2022 for a very good reason. It innovates world building, fragmented story telling or lore, and gives open world exploration a sense of true discovery and adventure.
I've finished it on PlayStation 4. Experience it on PC was a blast. The atmosphere was gorgeous and it still giving the same experience with PS4 of course but with different settings and I can play multiplayer now without those subscription. Still love the game, it was my first souls game, it was a fresh perspective as I though souls game is really hard to play but thanks to make this game more forgiving for the new players FromSoftware. I probably consider to play DS trilogy, BB and Sekiro if I have courage enough lol.  The only issues I having is the FPS sometime dropping  but I'm okay with 45 FPS and it was pretty smooth.   When playing multiplayer sometimes I don't know they either use original items or mods because you encounter them especially during invasion or they invade you, it will bring unbalanced to the game but hey it still fun by getting your ass kicked.   The boss was pretty good but spamming AoE was really make the boss fight annoying mostly on Godfrey and Radagon while Elden Beast keep get away from you was also annoying. Too many same mini bosses but I understand the reason of the repetition because for lore accuracy or possibly run out of ideas due to largest open world design but still, I was hoping different types of bosses to be include.  I'm hoping IF the DLC was really exist, I definitely will play it and it will be new experience like the first time I step into The Lands Between.
Nice

very good fight!

mi reseña de este juego Why Elden Ring is a masterpiece in 5 sentences numero 1: It's a game from fromsoftware 2번: It has potbois numéro 3: Alexander is in this game 4. szám: los graficos son geniales тоо 5:Hidetaka Miyazaki me mantiene encerrado en su sótano y me tortura constantemente. Por favor, ayuda. (Buy the game) 
AAAAAAAH-RISE NOW, YE TARNISHED
Bonk veri gud
This game is perfect for fans of souls-like games, it's very vast and, while some bosses do appear more than once throughout the world, it really makes exploration worth it, it's probably the peak of open world games and I can confidently say that after finally beating all the bosses.  Finally, an open world game done right (since most of them are deep as a puddle, eg. Ubisoft titles) and it's souls-like on top of that.  And as a side note: if you're having performance issues, run the game in offline mode.
is fun, don't look up build strats or else the game becomes overly trivial
Put these foolish ambitions to rest
VERY GOOD GAME! 100/10 BLOODBORNE ON PC NEXT!
Possibly the most fun freeroam rpg since Skyrim
EZ 10/10
fuck that big ass whale at the end, good game
Honestly as a first time Soulsgame for me it was scary at first, until you reconfigure your mind to stop caring about deaths and go uuga buuga it becomes a lot more fun.

1st time through: gets fucked for 6th time by boss but gets health down below half, Me: That doable 2nd time through: why did i have trouble with this crap
Just play it.  And if you don't like it then play it for 50 hours and then you'll love it. (Note: If you find assassins creed difficult then good luck)
It's fine. It's kind of boring. "WOW 10/10" are reviews that do not make any sense. it's a big boring static world.  enemies are sponges and you are a delicate flower. There is no fine level crafting as there is in the previous games. Those games had hand made environments that served a purpose. The environment here have zero purpose except to waste your time. It's a big empty field with some enemies strewn about. Wow. It just Doesn't feel the same as Dark Souls 3 for example. That game is also way more beautiful than Elden Ring, again because the environments were hand crafted and focused. FOCUSED. here you aim in any direction and find empty space. I've tried to like it. It's fine and a little boring. "WOW 10/10" is really annoying me now and how everyone seems to have fallen for it. i'd give it an 80% score based on how repetitive the entire world is.
If you value your social life, avoid this game at all costs.. That being said, you're here.. reading this.. you know you're gonna buy it anyways, you don't really need me to convince you to do it.. You're just here to validate the decision you already made.. So whatcha waiting for? Continuing to read this is just costing you time you could be spending in Caelid... actually, good choice, keep reading.. stay away from Caelid.
What can I say that has not been said?
is ok
Screamed so loud in rage that my neighbours called the police
GOTY
I get that a lot of people like this game, and there are many likable things about it. It's certainly a complete and high quality game (unlike most games released these days). The early sequence with the castle is great, exploring was fun... sometimes. But unfortunately this is a wiki-game. I'm gonna compare this a lot to BotW because that was a good open world game. If you're not playing a basic strength build or know how to find the overpowered weapons you're guaranteed to have a bad time.   The rpg mechanics are fundamentally unfun here. If you put points in multiple stats to use cool new items you will just have an incredibly weak character. Instead focus on only one stat and use almost no items. Great thanks, love that. Imagine if that happened in BotW? I guess the idea is to make more than one character. But nah. I'm good.   But then the real fail is still coming. So far, these issues existed in DS3 & DS1, but those games are still incredible. So why is this one particularly awful? *  This is such a wiki-game it hurts. The summoning bell is given randomly at night time at the first bonfire. What an incredibly dumb decision. Why does it feel like this game was designed to randomly make some people have a good time and for some people the game will be unplayable? This didn't happen to me, I was able to buy the bell at firelink shrine for some reason. There are many more examples of dumb shit like this. *  Open world does us no favors here. Randomly stuck in crystal cave with only enemies that one shot me? Why? Copy paste dungeons with weak rewards. I snooze. Breath of the wild shrines were always unique and interesting. An endless array of locked doors to which I must randomly find keys? Why?  Okay so you want me to explore. I'll try that. Crossed a bridge, fought some giants. That was pretty fun, cool stuff. Now what, it seems to be a dead end. Do I need to go inside the bridge? Jump at a certain angle? There must be a secret I missed somewhere. No, it turns out this is a place you can go to after you beat Godrick. Otherwise it's a waste of time.  How twisted is this. You want me to explore an 'open world' but in reality you want me to randomly stumble to find the intended linear path.  Just take assets and give me DS4 instead. I thought I might just follow a walkthrough so I could experience it without the tedious metroidvania openworld dogshit. But it just feels like a chore to be honest. A wiki-game will always be a wiki-game. Can put this one in the same bucket as dwarf fortress. It really pains me to bash Elden Ring since so many other people seem to like it. I liked DS1 & DS3 so I thought I would be like them. But alas, I am not.
Genuinly AMAZING cant not believe i put if off for nearly a year
very cool and good 
real good
perfection
noice

Best open world game I've ever played even though half the time I'm wandering the world with no Idea what I'm doing. Definitely worth the money!
Seek Maiden  but Hole
I am still not done with my first playthrough. I don't want it to end tbh  Do yourself a favor and get this game. Don't give up on the first boss. It get's way better
Its Elden Ring I don't need to explain why its good Its just good
Pretty great, as advertised. TONS of content and lots of boss fights. You can definitely get overleveled and finish even the end bosses pretty easily, but the beginning may be a bit rough.
Riding through the land with grace and might, Slayin' foes left and right in sight. Goblins, dragons, and beasts so bold, No challenge too great, no story untold. With sword in hand and horse at lead, Victory is what I surely glean. So let the foes come one by one, For on horseback, my battles are won.  5/7
game of the year , thats it
9.5/10  Absolutely incredible, I love it to bits, and it may even be my favorite game EVER(Breath of The Wild being it's competitor. We'll have to see If Tears of the kingdom can best either though.) I'd say it's a must have if you love open world games, though if you don't enjoy the punishing difficulty, I Suggest going to nexus mods and downloading an easy Elden Ring mod. Or at the very least, a mod that rebalances the game. I have no doubt that many may find that statement blasphemy, but I believe it's fine as long as the user is having fun.    I do have one issue though, and that is how quests are handled. A concerning amount of quests in the game, perhaps even most of them, are incredibly hard to follow. Really the only one that's easy to follow is the default main story quest. Most others require incredible luck, unending wit, or a simple google search for a guide. If they included a quest book of sorts, with simply reminding you of what npcs have said, and some slight nudges in the right direction, it would improve the game greatly. I'd go as far as to give it a 10/10 if there was.  TL;DR I fully recommend it. I love it dearly, despite not having even finished it, and give it a 9.5/10. It would be 10/10, if they included a quest book, and perhaps some much needed rebalancing.
Beautiful art style, intriguing lore, great game mechanics, I love it. I just wish some NPC's stories could have more endings, sometimes the RP feels linear.
BEST GAME EVER!!
Elden Ring 2 when?
10/10 Marriage Simulator.
I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Elden Ring and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

great open world  game is hard feels very rewarding
#1 gamer game
One of the best games I have ever played.
THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE, BEATEN AFTER 56 HOURS, AS WELL AS MELANIA HELL YESSS
Oyun güzel ama benim kollarım yok.
I died
ange ama radahn 
is gud
Elden Ring is the first of the "Souls" games that I have played. It's a beautiful and vast game that does not hold your hand whatsoever. Beware those with ADD, Elden Ring will have you bouncing all over the map between level farming and the lack of structure. A true open world experience, but this game will kick your butt!  Things I don't like - Controls can be clunky on keyboard Lack of quest management  Menu navigation  Things I enjoy -  Challenging  Rewards for exploring Not being penalized for trying new things in game Torrent Level Detail Game doesn't crash Map size The amount of different foes Music and ambient sounds Visuals Truly open world
TRY FINGER BUT HOLE !
Good but I want Vare to be my maiden or an option to be maidenless. Also more co-op options would be nice.
very fun
Game is pure quality!
very nice game
11/10
Runs great on steam deck!  Praise the sun ☀️
Praise O' dog
Still not as good as Bubbsy 3D babyyyyy
Moonveil goot
good game
10/10 worth the money I paid for.  Malenia was easy. Why do people mald over her?
FromSoftware game, what else do you need.  Play it
I need dlc
best game i've ever played
Yes.
amazing game.
The game is an awesome evolution of the souls game genre. It gives so much depth to the genre through customization. My only qualm would be that the initial class choice is kinda pointless especially for the good players out there. But everything else is perfect. I would 100% buy a DLC for this once I complete my 1st run.
Beautiful open world with plenty to explore. Bosses are difficult but not impossible. Graphics are so pretty. If you are a gamer and have the time to put into this game please try!
good gameplay, excellent open world a solid 7.5/10 i cant rait it higher cuz there absolutely no story, just a few cutscenes.
hours of fun
Easily one of the best games I've ever played. I'm an avid open-world player, this was my second FromSoft title, first being Sekiro. I found Sekiro far more fun to replay but I find Elden Ring adds depth and meaning to character building and customization. Easily a great game, you will get frustrated if this is your introduction to FromSoft games. I remember the first few days were rough, but now I have the time of my life in the Lands Between!
Played this on playstation and thinking whether or not to get this on pc as well..  One of the best games I've ever played for sure
Whats to say that hasn't already been said
This game can be fun if you have no life and live in your parents basement. Not made for casual gamers or really anyone who wants to have fun while playing video games. if you are willing to dedicate hours of your life you will probably enjoy it, but I hate and its too hard for me.
Probably THE BEST Souls game i've played in a long time.
Git gud
It tests my patience, and gives me anxiety when I dont find a grace for a little to long but I cant stop shit playing my way through  
.
best game
 Great game despite some flaws like how some boss can just one shot you and poise is a joke but if your a fan of fromsoft games this is for you and if its to hard just be a mage its easy mode anyway
Great video game. GOTY
Getting to NG+5 on the non steam version, I can definitely say I've played a lot more than my steam hours states. This game has got to be one of my favourite games in terms of how it just seems to grab my attention at every moment. I always have a goal to reach, a quest to complete, a skill to hone.  Always having something to strive towards, that changes as frequently as it does in elden ring is something truly wonderful - it's never a dull moment - and is one of the few progression-based games I can confidently say I have not gotten tired of after a few hundred hours. DLC to come soon I hear, so I will be looking forward to that, but for now - community creations are splendid for adding a little bit more to the game that you just needed, such as; different combat styles, gameplay changes, difficulties, graphics, fixes, styles and presets  10/10 gameplay (difficult if you want it to be, easy if you want it to be) 10/10 graphics (actual game areas are visually splended; but in terms of just graphics itself, you can also mod in high quality textures, meshes and RTGI if you feel it doesn't suit your needs) 7/10 performance (some VERY small bugs you may run into once in your entire playthrough, as well as some slight FPS stuttering in certain areas {both fixable with mods})  Would 9/10 recommend to everyone, I'll save that extra 1 for that specific audience that seems to always despise souls-type games.
Its amazing, get it and be prepared to die.
Great game, amazing replay ability, and super game play. Upgrade your weapons, fight bosses, and collect shards of the Elden Ring. (also 76mchoi's favorite game to absolutely get destroyed at and rage until he gets destroyed again)
This game has caused me a lot of pain and suffering but has also brought me great joy. The feeling of beating a boss you have been stuck on for awhile is euphoric. Great times indeed.
meh games alright
definitely worth playing through if you like RPG fantasy games that are open world and with a bit of a challenge.
Rise, Tarnished! Tis time to git gud.
One of the greatest games I have ever played. The graphics are amazing, the combat is next level, the bosses and enemies are insane, and the animations are stunning. definitely recommend to everyone and worth the price
very fun
\fyn
Best open world souls game I've ever played. It's easier than other FromSoft games, so I'll recommend this game to everyone, even if it's your first time playing this kind of genre.  This game really consume my life. Really recommended
DARK SOULS 1+3>ELDEN RING
wonderful game first soul game i played
Its really hard and so am I
so friggen hard but help is there, the harder the game was the more fun and challanges accepted moments you wanna have! Great fun with friends when they are summon able or with randoms even!
i keep dying but that's what makes me play:/
Best at being the worst GoTY.. 10/10
yes
The RPG where you roleplay as the victim  10/10, i want to die myself
I 100%’d the achievements on Eldern Ring for Xbox. Now I plan to do it again on Steam. I hate this game.
i love it
The combat is pretty fun. A nice introduction for the genre.  Take open world with a grain of salt, you're either levelgated or running into giant cliffs everywhere.
good
 Malenia beat my ass. Highly recommend
I really like the open world concept.  Always new and different places to explore.  Very difficult game for me, but I will be a better overall player with increased experience.
It is an unforgiving game but it does offer a wealth of things to do and explore.
Phenomenal souls borne game.
My very first souls game, has inspired me to play the rest. Definite recommend!
It's amazing, best open world game I've played with that Dark Souls rage inducing gameplay. Delicious
greatest game of all time
i hate this game but i have foolish ambitions
i honestly dont know how suffering is fun, but it is
Whenever I'm in a feud with my wife, I hop onto this game just to remind myself why she'll always be the second priority.  FromSoftware time and time again upholds their renown by tarnishing marriages since the dawn of civilization.   For that I couldn't praise this game enough.
Large map = lots to do, Try fingers, Butt hole
get gud
Do you like wanting to bash your fucking brains in? GAME FOR YOU! 
game hurts me deep down......10/10
This game cured my maidenless-ness
very nice ngl
amazing
i never thought i'd enjoy a souls game because i suck at video games, but suffering in elden ring has been so worth it. the absolutely gorgeous and immersive open world and lore has made progressing feel so rewarding and the combat is so much fun! 5/5 would let malenia make shish kebab out of me again.
pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
challenging and confusing, but fun.
no
goat
Fun AF
Meh at best. I really don't get why is this game special. Just another Dark Soul game. Everything is clumsy in this game, from combat, to camera rotation and following. I have a feeling that they made it intentionally bad, to spice gameplay experience. I saw a lot of people playing Elden Ring, and to be honest, you would have to be big mazohist to play this.
Yea, game good
Pain.....
very good touched my peepee but i touched it back
top tip: play as a mage until you feel comfortable with the game, then respec into Melee later on, it'll make the game much more inviting and new player friendly. That being said. don't expect a free pass. you're still going to die many times and learn to love it.
GOOD
mint.
gud for git gud enjoyer
Fun Game
gru
its sexy
good game
i broke my controller
This actually feels like you`re playing a game, not watching one
Suicidal
Dog
I've played most of from software's games and this is the only one that made me want to actively replay it because of how I just know I missed something around a corner or there's an area that I want to explore more. Landmark souls game that increases accessibility, encourages experimentation, and tempts you with new scenic vistas to explore. All the while keeping the famed difficulty. Best game I've ever played
fun
Challenging until you learn how to play.
mmmmmmmmmmm
It's ok
LOVE IT
GOTY istg
Very good game open world enemy, it really hard to fight a boss. Make you die a lot
Don't buy this if you're afraid of losing
Open Game.  Step out into the world.  See giant man on horse with a halberd.  Run at him naked with your stick.  Die instantly.  Repeat until success.  10/10 Game of the year. Would rush headfirst into death again.
Me swing sword at big foe: Get killed. Me swing bigger sword at big foe: Get killed. Me swing giant sword at big foe:  Kill foe. Giant sword good.
Easily top 5 games of all time
fromsoft at their finest
Rather than explain why Elden Ring is great (it is if it wasn't obvious), I wanted to use this review to highlight two incredible mods for the game: Seamless co-op (which makes full co-op exploration and progression possible) and Elden Ring Reforged (rebalances several mechanics/weapons/skills/etc., adds difficulty scaling, adds a semblance of "classes", adds content, and more). Both mods have elevated the experience for me beyond the vanilla experience, and I highly recommend them even if you're just starting out.

This'll do till Silksong
this game sucks dick
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa but in a good way
10/10 Masterpiece
One of the greatest games ever made
soccery is 2 ez
Good gem.
My only recommendation is buying a new controller with a protection plan.
its fun
If you like the PAIN and SUCCESS of achieving things. This game is definitely for you.
I was very happy that elden ring won goty 2022, but now I want all games from software to lose, even if the game is good, it's abusive what they did with the price of other games, it's even worth reporting it yes, games from years ago...
good soup
pain
You get to play Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord I only got the Stutter-Ring and became the Edge-Lord  We are not the same    [Jokes aside the game is so damn good like seriously just get it guys whether you like souls game or not, the exploration itself is very rewarding*ᶦⁿ ᶦᵗˢ ᵒʷⁿ ʷᵃʸ and it deserved all the awards it gets no doubt.]
mogh has been arrested under the crime of [[REDACTED]]
Die by boss 20+ times then have a 1% chance to kill the boss. But fun.
Just Incredible, loads of repeatability
This game reminded me that I'm tarnished and maidenless... 10/10
One of the best games of all time.
10/10
game good
Yes
most game per game i have ever gamed
the best. nothing more to say.
lots of death  :)
This was my first fromsoft game and i had an amazing experience whilst playing
Hands down the best open world action game ever made. Perfectly utilizes its open world to let you either beat your head against the wall like a DS game or explore and find a more tactical solution. Subpar RPG at best. The story is fantastic, but it's not told to you and the endings (mostly) aren't anything to write home about. If you don't care about story, play Elden Ring. If you do care about story, watch everything VaatiVidya has made, and then play Elden RIng.
hyetta best girl
i mean its alright i guess 
The camera/targeting system in this game is colossal ***. The longer you play it the more you notice the faults but the first time you take it out for a spin it will give you some pretty good memories.  A great game but could use some simple quality of life fixes to terrain/hitboxes and other areas that have weird glitches/interactions.
Great design, big game, lots to keep you busy, but it can be hard.
Get God of war instead. Hands down. Perhaps what I am describing below is what mainly or partly explains the Elden rings award of "BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT AWARD". The character control in this game is not as natural as any other RPG game I´ve played before when using keyboard and mouse. During fights, it´s almost like your mouse&keyboard turns into a D-pad. That´s the best way of describing it. The precision of that is obviously useless when trying to hit your enemies. During a fight you´ll basically be swinging your weapon front, right, left or rear. Not by the aim of your mouse. I think most people who´ve played god of war know´s what I am saying here. I am glad I got it for 50% but if I knew this I would not have bought this game.  
gud gejm and im gay
Nice
amazing game, just trust me
If you like Open World Games like I do then you would like this, worth every penny.
its noice 
God I love this game, I never played any DarkSouls so I would describe this as Skyrim but with enemies on steroids.
game
Now whenever i am faced with a challenging task, I know the first step is to try finger but hole
gud game
Elden Ring is basically an open world version of the Dark Souls games with some serious improvements. The first improvement being there's a story at play that doesn't require heavy investment into paying attention to the item description based lore. That lore is still there, so don't get that crossed. The second huge improvement is that there's real platforming to do, though it only plays out in fights or boss battles some of the time. Most combat isn't much different than in the Souls titles, however, we've a dedicated jump button, ash summons, and several other tools at play we didn't in those other games. Would go on, but I'm pretty sure most people already know what to expect of a Souls-like game. My only word of warning is that this isn't Dark Souls. It's much easier if you wanna make it easier. It's also much harder if you wanna make it harder. By which I mean Elden Ring is really Dark Souls with options. A lot of different options to every fight and choice you make in game just about.  The PC version at this point in time is the best place to play Elden Ring in my opinion. Runs very smoothly. That said, I'm writing this at 200+ hours and leaving only the last boss to beat. (It seems like there's a lot of things in the PC version of the game that isn't on the console versions, though I'm not mentioning any of that because I'm uncertain if it's due to the updates since launch or not.)
It's ok
One of the best games I ever played, even with the boss repetition and some horrible design choices, it still stands high as a masterpiece, though I have to warn you: THIS ISN'T DARK SOULS 3, and if you play it as dark souls 3, you will suffer. Most of the negative reviews I've seen face this issue, they say the game is unfair because their roll spam doesn't work, when the game literally punishes that, this is elden ring, use the new mechanics to your advatage and not just try to replay ds3 2 but ow.
IF you think you can't play and beat a Souls game let me introduce you to the wonderful world of BLUE MAGICS tm
Could this be a review?  (Had to put up review because I'm at 69 hours)  Some pros:  *Spectacular open world, without overbearing markers and logs, emphasizing exploration. *Memorable, distinct atmosphere and design. *You can tell there's worldbuilding of unusual quality hiding in the background (probably GRRM work). *Excellent, well-balanced combat which rewards you for paying attention and preparing. *Best game since Witcher 3.  Some cons: *Performance issues on PC (mostly stuttering) *The difficulty curve, and how you progress through the game, is somewhat poorly executed and balanced, but it's fine. *Probably not the best UI and control scheme. *A lot of players who think the high difficulty means they're special for beating the game.  10/10 Game
well rounded game, its long but not too repetitive. pvp is a nightmare of toxicity getting teamed-up on is annoying though.
Probably the best world building and game play I have experienced.
rivers of blood is gay but i still use it
:)
godskin duo kontol
Everyone mock us for being maidenless and we slaughter them all and got witch wife.  Good game 10/10   
Better than Bloodborne. Malenia > Orphan of Kos.
no
The best Souls game I've played so far. As someone who's played DS2, DS3, and Sekiro I think this is by far my favorite. The lore for this game is absolutely brilliant. The customization is good, there's 100's of weapons to choose from, and a great amount of bosses to overcome. 10/10 game for me. Highly encourage anyone to pick it up.
Schway
Great game. The cliffs are pain and also, if you see margit then tell him that he is tarnished. Please. He made me pop like 99% of my blood vessels. So like. Murder him. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please.  ''Well, thou art of passing shillings.'' - Margit, The Fell Omen                                                              ((((((Original Joke))))))
goty for a reason
good game make blood vessel pop

Took me 300 hours to beat, that elden ring marika pussy got a mf acting rather unwise.
The greatest FromSoftware game I've ever played and the best open world RPG. Everywhere I go there's something to find some new boss to fight some new weapon, a new incantation, sorceries, bows, shields just something worth finding and the good feeling I get when I do so. This game has attached itself to  the receivers in my brain that have turned into ELDEN RING receivers instead. The first 40 hours of the game are honestly the best experience I've had in a while and I wouldn't trade it for anything else.     There is a reason why I said the first 40 hours though, after leaving the capital city, Leyndell, the quality takes a dip. And a DIP at that. Most bosses I saw in very special places and got to fight at the end of long questlines are just in mines and out in the open just sitting there for no reason. In the early game whenever I got to see a big enemy I always wanted to fight and best them but in the snow covered mountaintops all I've ever done is just wave past with Torrent.   I think the issues in the game can be fixed, but the community's point of view towards issues are also something to be wary of. The "hardest" fight, Malenia, is barely hard if  you're using every tool the game gives you to beat her. The reason a lot of the bosses in the game feel like they were made for Sekiro and not Elden Ring and there being no way (literally no way, like there isn't a single way you don't take damage in some bosses' attacks) is because you aren't using Spirit Ashes to pull aggro from the boss, which seems like that's what they were balanced towards. However, I will agree that spirit ashes feel like you're "cheating" towards the latter stages of the game (especially mimic) and balancing them will no doubt prove extremely difficult for FromSoftware.      Overall, this game is the greatest open world RPG to come out in 2022 and before that and I reckon it will stay that way for a while.
Fantastic game and as an introduction to fromsoftware offers a magnificent plot and plenty of lore to keep you entertained while offering some of the most challenging battles and timing

I didn't expect the game would be that great, It's a really huge map & stuff on it, worth all the time I've spent on it so far and I am pretty sure gonna be still playing it even after defeating all the bosses.
Good Game, very fun, very happy
Best game ever made
One of the best games ive played in a long time
Good game but f u c k Elden Beast
/
This game doesnt deserve game of the year its dogshit
YOU DIED
I have killed numerous demigods but I cannot kill the giant bears.  Good game.
There's lots of wolves in this one and I like it.
many rings <3
BANGER
This game is very good
Ground shattering game by frontsoftware. Was the best of its time and still holds to this day. Best souls like ive ever played would recommend 10/10
Destined Death...please give me more
very goood 
I've been playing RPGs since I got my N64 and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in 1998.   I can easily say Elden Ring is one of the greatest games ever made.
If sticking a Glock down your throat while sitting on a cactus in late spring truly wasn't enough pain for ya, you've come to the right place. As you explore the map or as I refer to it as "self induced gamer purgatory" you will come across many interesting characters, most of which will have your runes scattered across the floor before you have the time to process the utter trauma you have just witnessed your character endure (yes all their pain is your fault, I hope you feel bad) The versatility when creating your build is incredible, now your character can die to an enemy: From afar Up close While trying to cast magic While trying to cast religious magic While getting screwed from every angle From across the map From just outside the cameras view While crafting While sleeping While on the way to pick your kid up from soccer practise And yes, at your very expensive keyboard's funeral
Game was aids no s*x scenes i punted my infant daughter because of the bs that is caused by this game  10/10 do not recommend if you have a infant daughter    Update: she died
ghot
For the record, I am not a soulsbourne guy but in the future i could be a soulsbourne guy. If your umming and ahhhing about elden ring then take my advice kid......buy it you won't be disappointed.   Good luck my fellow tarnished
turtles
g
very good
is good n hard
10/10 Maidenless!
what!?!
I like this game
Bok gibi oyun.
Best game I've played in a while.  This is my first experience with a souls-like and I have greatly enjoyed it. It's definitely difficult, and you may have to 'git gud' but it gives you a lot of freedom to tackle challenges they way you prefer and in the order you prefer. There's a lot of room for you to upgrade your skills and equipment such that each boss fight is accessible. The open world is massive and gives a genuine feeling of adventure and discovery, as well as danger. You never know what you will run into as you cross the lands between.  This game deserves all the awards it gets. It's a breath of fresh air among all the cash-grabs coming out of the AAA industry..* cough * EA Sports ... If you're thinking about getting this, get it. Just get it. It's worth every penny.  
gg
May chaos take the world!
把你他妈的闪退修修好！ Fix your goddamn crashes!!! あなたのひどいクラッシュを修正してください!!!  AND STOP USING EASYCHEAT!!! IT ANTI NOTHING BUT MY PC!! EASY ANTI-CHEAT使用を中止する!!それは私のPC以外は何も停止しません!!
gua xnk komen lebih2 mat, game ni mmg best. Walaupom gua sangkut lawan boss tapi gua still enjoy 
yes very good game good
Do it for Melina and Ranni <3
Good game, but it ruined gaming for me. When I try to play other games, they turn to ash in my mouth. There is no more joy for me in this lifelong hobby, just an eternity of waiting for Elden Ring dlc to be announced. 10/10
Elden ring :)
.
If you value your time when playing games then don't play this. The developers hate you and don't respect your time by forcing you to lose all runes(cash) upon death you will grind the same thing over and over again for no real reason other than you need runes to level up and they penalise you every time you level by charging more each time and every time you level it's a case diminishing returns the increments get small and smaller each time. The target lock-on system is broken you can be looking directly at an enemy and it won't lock on when you press right stick.  I still haven't finished the game yet after 200+hours. Just found out that there are 713 levels to get to max wtf that's a lot of rune farming to do how do they expect I to get to max before the end I presume cause there is some npc and bosses that I just can't kill no matter what I do.  Does not support UWQHD monitors despite it being an option in settings what the point of having it if they don't support it.
Elden Ring
Excellent game, one of the greatest ever
nice
crucible knights.
Does not support 3440 x 1440p Ultrawide Monitors. Sad :(
neat, but the coop-with-friends without mods is really bad. 9/10
just finished the tutorial, so far so good
It's good
"... You are Maidenless"
If you are a Souls fan then its definitely the game for you! Im not a big fan of dark souls but Bloodborne is my favourite game of all time and Elden ring scratches that itch. Guess I have two favourite games now!
Lovely little game, much fun :3
dog ahed
i got this game 10 days ago, it is now my second highest played game on my library. this game is absolutely incredible and the amount of content is wild
its just good 
cool game
this game is so hard i cant even beat the soldier of godrick 0/10
Dark Souls 3.05 with an open, empty world.  Fromsoft is getting lazy and complacent thanks to their hardcore niche fanbase who hold them to no standards.
Not quite as good as likes bloodborne and sekiro but is close definitely a huge improvement on the souls series. 
Absolutely incredible from start to finish.
It's Dark Souls meets Skyrim. Incredibly addictive, huge open world with deep lore and punishing difficulty.
This game changed my life... But I am still confused did it change for the better or the worst. But this game is FIRE the game of the year title is an understatement to say the least. I recently got all the achievements and I feel accomplished no matter how loud I screamed at my monitor in the process it was still quite the experience. This game broke me and rebuilt me... this game made me into a new man. I can't wait for stuff like DLCs to come out. But even though I got all of the achievements it doesn't mean that I am done with this game and that's what it does to you it's addictive but sorta in a good way. That's all I have to say about this game it is truly amazing.
perfect
worth so much more than $60
TOGETHAAA, we shall become elden lord
Nice
Awesome Game
Sweet game, so good makes me kinda addicted. I need to finish this game soon.
This was a outstanding game with sever breathe taking moments!
2k hours on PS5 just here to have more than 10 character slots because making builds in this game is super fun
Reused bosses
Its a pretty good game.   A good amount to see and do.  Also the bosses are pretty fun.
i like elden ring its very fun
goat
pretty mean
let me turn off grass.
maidenless.
P
uhhh
ver fun
So, I've seen many tutorials on the game, many builds and playthrough's and I really wanted to play the game, so I bought it ( obviously), after that i boot up the game and guess what, White screen error crash upon startup, I cant even play game and I've dont everythingto fix it, so I'm still going to put a checkmark only because It's a good game, but I still cant play it : /.
BEST if you go on to NJ 2 !
.
its elden ring
i grinded this game mercilessly and did literally everything until i got to the final boss (which i gave 27 attempts), then i gave up. oh well onto other things..
this game is the grand delusion that youll enjoy this trash keep, youve played ds3, cool fuck off, you played ds1 and 2 cool fuck off, i love rolling with perfect timing for the game to fuck you over. why is this game on my library i was forced to play it do i want to, no i would rather put a shotgun barrel in my mouth rather than play this shit.
I highly recommend this game.  It is difficult and you will die many, many times.  You will get frustrated you will think there is no way you can advance but you must continue , just one more, one more death.  Then you advance, you achieve your goal and defeat the foe only to have to fight once more only this enemy is even tougher.  The story is crazy, the enemies are mighty but the game is the best ever to date.  Just buy it already and say good bye to your girlfriend, tell your wife to leave you the f*ck alone and play Elden Ring.
IT IS FOOKEN MINGING
Surely I wont run a dex build this time...
Time for crab
I like it more than it makes me hate myself
GOTY
Waiting for DLC...
This game is beautiful, but once I got to the Mountaintops, I stopped being able to appreciate it.  Elden Ring's -- like the Dark Souls series before it -- is a combat system built on limitations. Every offensive and defensive option is carried out with either stamina or focus (that is, if you're using magic or ashes of war.) You've also got input buffering to deal with, where button presses have a noticeable delay, and the game registers every input, which WILL lead to accidental panic rolls, drinking flasks one too many times, and doing a mistaken follow-up R2 after doing a jump attack.  It's a feature endlessly at odds with the committal controls. You can't cancel your animations, so a good handful of player deaths are a result of people failing to account for an enemy's unavoidable punisher(s) while they're stuck in some animation. This wouldn't be such an issue if enemies didn't all have uniquely rapid combos they can chain together endlessly, and that's on top of everything being way too fast and two-shotting you in the endgame. Not even just bosses, but regular enemies. Many bosses and enemies are simply designed with movesets meant to counter the "few" combat mechanics you have at your disposal.  However, I have to say "few" in quotes because there is a wide variety of spells in the game, along with many special attacks you can add to weapons in the form of ashes of war. If you're able to find an effective combination of these things, you can trivialize a lot of the fights, but this solution highlights my main grievance with this game. If something isn't working, you're not meant to adapt to an enemy until it does. You're meant to trivialize the shit by min-maxing. That kind of stuff may be fun for PVP, but, unless they're an invader, enemies don't play by the same rules you do.  All of this wouldn't be such a problem if there were another angle to the gameplay, but fighting your way through the world is the only thing your character is good for, sadly. And that's a real shame when you have such cool a setting with so many major characters. Imagine pledging fealty to a Shardbearer with a kneel emote in the middle of battle or something, and then you get to join their faction instead of just killing every single one of them. That's the kind of shit I play RPGs for, but all you get here are fragmented questlines you need spoilers just to complete, and omniscient item descriptions.  My final note: I know nothing of the game's community or meta or what-have-you, but if the only way I can enjoy or beat a game is by looking up everything and playing it someone else's way, then the game just ain't for me. And on the off-chance you're anything like me, then it probably ain't for you either.
Best game evar
One of the greatest games I've ever played, worth every dollar.
bole la bole la siok jugala
It's funny because of the woman
Very fun but maliketh is impossible for me!!!!!
horse souls. the open world is an improvement on the dark souls formula.
The best game ive ever played
if you like pain get this
Maybe the most video game video game of all time.
This game is a masterpiece, I genuinely couldn't recommend a game as highly as Elden Ring.
The amount of gameplay time and customization is definitely one of the things this game have over other souls game fromsoft made, but on top you can kill varre which is probably the best part of the game so far. A step up from dark souls, but still not a masterpiece since it has room for improvements
GOY
This is THE fantasy game in my opinion. The world is massive and immersive. The combat is fun and engaging,  although difficult. The art direction in general is beautiful and makes the game seem almost intimidatingly massive in scale. Great variety in just about everything weather it be setting, weapons, music, characters. If you like souls games or just fantasy in general this is a must play, and (in my opinion) completely worth the amount of money charged.
goated 
Game of the year for a reason.  Must have!
a lot of the bosses are just normal enemies with bigger numbers, absolutely worst boss design out of any soulsborne game that fromsoft made, enemies hitting through walls, wonky hitboxes (attacks that should hit me dont and vice versa), you look at the big map and find out that the end game area is not even 25% explorable, too many gank bosses and dont get me started on the mess that malenia is, dark souls player combat mechanics but enemies have sekiro/bloodborne movesets, open world is empty and there is barely anything to do and if you explore too much you WILL miss out on 70% of the quests if you dont have online guide open
MUINTU POGGERS
Fantastic game, I can't wait for future content, enjoy how active the dev team has stayed in regards to balancing patches, and it has absolutely earned its place as GOTY in my book. Keep up the great work devs!
Beat the game 3 times. You could say the game is ok.

FUCKING DIED ALOT!!! LOVED IT!!!!!
top 1 game oat. better than sex
The ever BRILLIANT GOLDMASK!!!!
amazing game ive played it multiple times on Xbox and one time on steam 10/10
Game hard I get carried to win
it's ok i guess
ah, pain
Witless Tarnished... Why covet Destined Death? To kill what?
Very good game, bit painful at some points but soon as you know boss move sets your big chilling
Best game hands down that I've ever played. Won Game Of The Year fair and square
go0od game
Pretty spicy. Some of the girls are hot but most of them end up dying or have bad shit happen to them.   The fights are cool too.  10/10 game
fun but difficult if you're bad like me
game is amazing, pain is suck
this game is perfect
gud game much hard
Elden Ring has phenomenal.. Everything? Yes it does! Tremendous open-world design, beautiful puzzles and dungeons, extraordinary boss and enemy design, fully orchestrated soundtrack with an array of elite compositions, fantastic replayability, and an environment that allows you to truly soak in the beauty. Its story is environmentally told, and allows you, the player to be the bearer of your own play style and destiny. In my opinion after playing 3000+ games in my lifetime, the greatest game ever next to Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild.
makes me wanna die 10/10
You can slap the ground with your dragonclaws and breathe fire, magic, ice and rot at your enemies like a dragon (sadly you can't transform into a goat or chicken this time). Overall, 10/10 would burn a host with his summons and teabag them again.
happy
Too many freezes on very high end machine. Known bug they just ignore. Couldnt enjoy the game since on stutter is death on  every class.
try finger but hole
Elden Ring
very fun
Great game 122 hours in game just beat it
Do not get this if you have a low end PC. Maybe a medium-high end PC can work.
amzing!
I'm an avid Fromsoftware fan, but everything in elden ring feels like a step back. It has some of the worst boss design in recent memory and the open world gimmick is frustrating and boring. I enjoy good combat more than anything else in a soulslike, not the constant feeling of getting lost. Elden ring traded good combat for even more navigation frustration. Better than DS2, but it's the second worst in the series.
its somethin'
great game
gud game
good game
BEST. GAME. EVER!!
perfection
Greatest game I ever played. So immersive and very beautifully orchestrated game.
fun
Very painful but very good game
i love being miserable
dog
Honestly it has been a blast playing this master piece. I would 100% recommend. Great Souls game!
its good
love it
Badass Game!
Bad game if you cant have it to die 12135098765329485 times dont buy it + if you alt tab or unfocus the game will crash instant. :)
WHY IS THIS GAME SO FUCKING MASSIVE.
very fun with friends and mods
I get to kill god
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.
Just yes
Game is addictingly fun, hundreds of hours worth of content and expansive world and lots of interesting lore!
good game
Elden Ring!! ok so... this game is great. But as usual, the multieplayer co-op. experince sucks. i recomend this game yes, but i prefer to co-operate with my brother, and well.. they should realy do it difrently to bad this game is cursed with shity multieplay.... and wayy too many areas were the co-op feature is just..locked of, this games graphix is it looks good but, it early ps4 grpx at Best! im so sick of me and my bro going thrue an area  and A, we have to turn  back case of an ivisable wall. B we have to deal with ivaders, witch... for the love of GOD Damn. LET US SHUT THAT INVADER FUNCTION THE FRICK OFF!!!!!!! or C the game dicides not to work. ya also frick the flowers, hate having to collect those evry time we wanna coop. if they fixed the co-op. this game whould be much better.
open world with try difficulty
Good game, great difficulty
haha funny number
I told myself many times before buying the game that Elden Ring would not be for me, and that it just wont be a game I would find myself seriously having fun playing. And after a while of friends telling me how good it was, and the game of the year award this game won, I bought the game and I immediately was hooked. Probably the best game ive ever played.
Never played a dark souls game before, but it is fun and challenging. I hate the interface though, in that locking on a target means it forces your character to turn and face the target, which can really screw with the third person camera angles. In combat you always have to face it, and cannot look away. So it's a pain to keep having to lock/unlock. So I usually just free-look, if that's what it's called.
tis a fun game and i recommend
dog 
beware its addicting
If you liked any Souls game you should really love this one. Playing Elden Ring feels like discovering a new world while learning the craft of monster killing. A little bit easier than Dark Souls though still a challenge (for me at least). This game really stays in your mind and comes back to haunt you. So beautiful and so unforgiving...
Very majestic and scrumptious I must say..
its alr fighting mechanics are  mid graphics are amazing you can be max level and have everything in the game and still get bodied by a fire giant
this is a game of all time. Fairly challenging, but not too unfair. Bring a lot patients and a warm blanky. Beating knights and eldrich horrors was never more satisfying
its good
gud game.
looks coool
I am Melina's greatest warrior, I don't give a shit about this Elden lord shit, pretty woman tells me to do something, I fucking do it.
shits ight
game in 2022 doesn't support 21:9
And here we go....by far the best rpg game I ever played. What a journey. Thanks FromSoft
This game is very easy to rage to but at the end we all pick back up the controller (or keyboard) and try again. 
the game was harder than the first 1 seconds of survival minecraft >:( Bad game, reminds me of Dark souls, Dark souls 2, Dark souls 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, for some odd reason  overall reminds me of my dad and i can't stand more than half a second on this game total
I love space war
gorgeous game when graphics are maxed. Good combat and exploration.
I was hating the game, then I stopped hating it and now I hate it even more. But it's a fun game, lots of challenges and also I think multiplayer coop should be allowed full time.
elden rings themes are of duality so much so that it has trancended the lore to the very game design. the first half of the game is beautiful one of the best games i have ever played, the last half of the game is one of if not the biggest dumpster fires i have ever played. i really want to like this game the lore is deep the visuals are stunning but the gameplay by the end is god aweful.
ASDFGHJKL
might just be the best game ive ever played
siker atar
deserves game of the year
hit and die
Best movement from fromsoft yet, great gameplay overall, fun story
As a new entrant to From Software games I must admit that the learning curve was quite steep. However, it is certainly worth it. World is astonishing, game mechanics brilliant and not holding you by the hand at every step is certainly nice new experience. The only downside I suppose that controls are not adjusted (or optimised) for Mouse and keyboard (Like why not navigate the map with mouse or no option to have more hotkeys...).
Ez game
I cried after being called maidenless,  10/10
best game ive ever played
BEST GAME; OF THE YEAR; NO CAP; 10000000000000/10 :)
delicious
I love this game, but sometimes it makes me want to eat my spleen.
One of the best games I have ever played only a few come close or beat.
ق
P A I N
Masterpiece
Fun.  10/10 would recommend.  can touch grass without going outside.
Oh, you don't have the right!  Great game, decent replay ability (more than most from their catalog I'd argue) and although a bit daunting in terms of flexibility of approach, probably one of the most accessible games they've made as well.  High recommend.
The best game
DLC please
nice good
When dlc, will there be a Elden ring 2, can we minimalize multiplayer dysync, have we discovered everything?
If you are debating getting this so much that you are reading reviews. Buy it. Best game i ever played.
Good game, idk why gow fans from tik tok complains abt it, sounds like an skill issue
cold
its like if BOTW actually had graphics and a combat system and was good
jogão.
This is the one game that ive played that i genuinly cant think of an issue that needs addressing, the boss fights, NPCs and everything else in the game are phenomanol, And when i say the lore is good, I mean its the most saddening and driven story ive ever seen in a game. The only issue that surrounds the game are the people who havent played it yet!!!
It was fun
very nice game
Good game overall. Falls apart somewhat in endgame and is too long in my opinion, but still a very good entry in the series.
dog
Time for Elden Ring, try skill.
Morgott's toes
Great game, mediocre PC port that you have to fix with mods
Tis goot
the best
First time fully committing to a souls like game and i had a great time.
just yes all you need to know is yes
Behold, dog! Therefore, 10/10
:)
it is hard but it is really fun
easy game
YAS!
What
This Game for Relaxing <3
Deserved to win game of the year. The environments are amazing, with a huge map to go with it. So many bosses to fight and tons of weapons to use and builds to make. Fromsoft made one of the best decisions ever to make this game open world. I can't wait for the dlc for this game. I wish i could replay this game for the first time again. 10/10
this game is awesome  not my first souls game but very very nice if you want to get into the genre.
More addictive than coke and gives you brain tumors.
Finally got all trophies, would say its 100% worth it
The only other game from From Software that I played was Dark Souls II: Schoolar Of The First Sin (DS2:SOF) wich I enjoyed a lot but I noticed that it was a really hated game from From Software and that Elden Ring was receiving a lot of praises and also won a GOTY so I tought "If their most hated game is this good then their most loved game must be extremely good!" but I ended up hating it ¿What's my problem?  -Attacks often have ridiculous delays. The problem with the delays is not that they take too long it's that the enemy simply stands there with their weapon up with little to no animation so you basically have to see them do the animation and start counting, get hit and remember to how much you counted everytime they do that attack again to properly dodge it. This happens for the whole game, even the final boss does it.  -Chain attacks are too fast sometimes. Sometimes the enemy follows an attack with another so fast that you still are on the roll animation you used to dodge the first attack, this doesn't happen very often but it's very frustrating when it does specially when it stunlocks you to death.  -The open world is too open. This one is more personal, probably most people will love this but I can't leave a zone peacefully without feeling like I missed half of the things it has to offer, and this does happen, unless you use a wiki to see where everything the zone has to offer is then you will miss dungeons, legendary armaments/magics and even NPCs with questlines. This probably helps make every person's walkthrough more unique when not using the wiki.  -Plenty of reused bosses. There are both reused bosses behind fog walls and on the overworld and because of the delayed attacks and the fast chain attacks finding a reused boss on the overworld as a normal enemy, respawning and all is painfull.
It is one of the most captivating games I have played in a while, Fromsoftware creating masterpieces back to back, from Bloodborne, to DS3, to Sekiro, and finally Elden Ring, they never let down once in many years.  If someone reviews this game and says it is overhyped without atleast having 20 hours into the game or atleast getting to the point of fighting Rennala, that person needs to GIT GUD. (jk) Tho I would enjoy a boss rush mode and even though it also felt the bosses weren't meant for this combat, the bosses are a visual eye candy and absolutely incredible to fight! (Not you godskin Duo)  Rating:  ☑️3D Platformer? Check ☑️Bosses which can make you rage quit? Check ☑️Do you need to git gud? Yes  ✅10/10, not maidenless anymore
Big Sex , much Elden too much Ring 10/10. Would let Ranni step on me again !!
its ight
Game is ok, the hype and being game of year lead to think was going to be much better. Combat is pretty meh, camera is terrible and physics are laughable. The world is amazing looking though.
isnaene
Large variety of weapons and playstyles. A large open world that has things hidden away everywhere. Fun bosses.
I came in with no knowledge and completely clueless. I never even seen any gameplay of the soul games. However with a fresh mind (mainly because i dont want to ruin my first time playing with watching youtube video about the game) Completely fresh. I have to say this, its a fucking good ass game. Now i see why it won the game of the year. so much to do. i spend 25 hours just exploring before fighting the first main boss. I just now kill Godrick and now unlocking the other half of the map. control is hard to use as a first timer, but easy to get used to. it's challenging but also very rewarding. just a great game.
it's ok i guess
O Tarnished! DLC ahead therefore finger hole...
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM YOU DIED
Yes
psikolojimi bozarak düzeltti. Güzel oyun.
Bill Clinton.
i hate this game 
Time for seed
Love it, hate it, but definitely love it
best game i ever played i recommend you to play
Elden Ring is an incredibly fun FromSoft game. AS per usual, combat is pretty difficult especially the father you get into the game. There are a ton of bosses to beat and side quests to accomplish. The open world aspect of the game is a nice change of place from FromSofts other titles. Definitely worth adding to your library
This game is what was on my mind since its release and is what made me get a job so I can play it, man was it worth it, Thank you Elden ring for convincing me to defeat irl Bosses
100% worth my money. This game is full of mysteries for you to explore and challenges. What are you waiting for?
Best game ever made
2022年最佳游戏
Favorite soulsborne game I've ever played. 10/10
self explanatory, man.
You don't have the right, o you don't have the right therefore 10/10  Btw don't try jumping
is okay
just finished sekiro and now starting with this. I feel like sekiro had better combat system.
Thanks Bill Clinton
Good game but the tree sentinel fisted my ass and ate me out for breakfast then packed the rest of my insides up for lunch
Very Good Game 10/10
I BEAT OFF TO RANNI 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
cum
2 of my saves got corrupted for no reson and i have to start over again
DLC of the year when?
good - will need a mid-high tier pc
Like it or hate it, deep down we all know its a good game, look what it did to me, pfp is me after Melania  still recommend the game
I Love this game! The world is Enormous, there are thousands of places to go and find loot. High replay ability. Tons of different weapons and spells, which is purely amazing! So many secrets and hidden places. I can talk about this game for hours, but it's better to play it :)  Overall a Masterpiece 9.5/10 :)  Not giving it 10 because some quest lines are really convoluted and give you absolutely no hints of where or how they progress. Also I really hope we can see real co-op multiplier(without mods) in their next game
good
You will witness true horror. Now, rot!
try jumping 
This game helps you come to terms with dying... a lot... in an absolutely gorgeous world full with lore having you arguing for hours with your friends on who's who and what's what. Probably one of the better souls games to start with if you are not used to these kind of games. But if you don't like dying, and you need the game to hold your hand through out, this is not for you. Tip, running away is a viable option.
nice
Fun game for people who enjoy challenge, utilize the tools at your disposal and keep trying to learn how the game is meant to be enjoyed, dying a lot is to be expected until you get the attack patterns of enemies / bosses down and the satisfaction of beating a boss that was giving you a hard time earlier is a integral part of the experience, only downside is the addition of larger world and mount mechanics but those can be ignored since mounts are not usable within "dungeons" / most boss arenas, all in all a good game with a lot of variety for playstyles if you don't like the game with a certain weapon try others or incantations / sorceries, fextralife has a robust wiki for all the information you need to make a proper build and to enjoy the game with items that suit your playstyle, experiment and upgrade your weapons and level your vigor to 40 for best experience  final note: if you want a good melee build try two katana type weapons dual wielded and do dodge roll attacks, jump attacks and crouch attacks, bleed is strong and katanas have inherent bleed build up to them, remember dying is not defeat, quitting is
Has fat enemies you can put to sleep by throwing pots at them
GOAT
One of the best game in years. The level of details in this game is out of this world!
.
So lets review +good music +nice viz +game length is about 20-25 hours of content, good compared to AAA 4 hrs  (see GoW, MW etc)  -No support for Keyboard and mouse (why port to PC and have no improvement on your DS BS). Tell me why i can't bind heal to one of the other 78 keys  -No map features or waypoints (waste 30 hours) -No journals (waste 10 hours) -Scrubs reeing about 'no journal is good' when it's just a waste of time - Give enemies 4x the amount of health they need and call it 'challange' (sic) -really slow ass rogue lite. In that light, rogue Legacy 2 was way better. -don't give an F** about your character, it's a mindless blob with no conscience (same for all JRPGs tbh) -no idea what's going on because the writers are lazy - oh wait guys you can't write a journal but magically can see enemy HP lul +only bought it because it was on sale +George Martin got a lot of hookers and blow because of this game.
great game
beautiful game and a great entry point to the souls like games for new players.
very god 
Perfect
Thank you, for guiding me here.
BEWARE OF STUTTERING ISSUE!! I still recommend thou.  Take the "Open world" to the next level. There's no clear path in this game. You just explore and do stuff. I'm 55 hours in and I think I still in the early to mid game in terms of main story. There're so much to explore. Never played anything quite "open world" as this one.  Also armor looks cool. That's sound like a win to me.
i want to die 👍👍👍
hugging woman gives debuff. based miyazaki
650 hours into this game and what do I have to show for it...  100% Completion 1 Broken Monitor 1 Broken Headset 1 Broken RL Family 0 Broken Maiden Hearts 100% Satisfaction  If you haven't played a soulsbourne game you're actually a BOT. What an amazing challenge and what an amazing ride it was. I haven't played it in months after I finished but all I can remember is how much I loved every second of it. No better or worse than any other souls game, just a sovereign, worthy and remarkable game to play. The gold standard for what all game developers should strive to create. <3
Great game
Goty game for sure. I didnt like souls games before Elden ring, it is really that good. Must try game of 2022.
Bought it  Played for an Hour  Horrible and boring game
Best Game Ever Made Hands Down
The best game i've ever played sadly there were some operation issues like torret and all the foes become invisible for a while.
ye
This game taught me the meaning of "F**k around and find out."
A MUST PLAY!
A True Art,One of The Most Sophisticated Masterpiece in this century
Redoing this because ive put more hours into since then. This game is phenomenal, I found myself frustrated and annoyed at times of difficulty but i always come back to this game. Its addicting to beat up cool enemies and get actual rewards for it. Ive not even finished the entire game yet because theres just so much content to do. Will it ever end?
the girl that came to help me is now chasing me for death 10/10 game
um penus
I can't find thhe horse lady
might have refunded this game 3 times but its great now pog 9.5/10 
My foolish ambition was laid to rest
Worth every penny
Bloodstain?! Seek skill...
cant have sex the fuck

OK I GET IT! I'm maidenless
Good game.
go fuck yourself fire giant
elden ring
You have to try this game out. I've played and beat all the fromsoft games multiple times, and this one stands next to all of them. I 100%'ed the game and I haven't felt inspired to do that with any of the others. This game is special and deserves all the love and play.
10/10   Story: The story is... complicated. a lot of the story and lore of the world is very hidden. speaking to npc's gives you scraps of what the world your currently in but if you want the real deep cut lore you have to go looking.  Graphics: Literately (and i don't mean that as figuratively)  one of the best looking games of all time. the only game i can say is better is red dead redemption 2. they have completely different art styles so it probably boils down to personal preference but the visuals are just amazing.  Gameplay: I am a newbie to souls likes so this perspictive is coming from that point of view. This game KICKED MY ASS! but it didn't really bother me too much since i was enthralled with the open world i just wounded up exploring and eventually i became compented and leveld up enough to face the "first real" boss. and man that was not easy. took me a good hour 1/2 but when i finally bested him the dopamine realse was so fucking worth it.  Conclusion: this game is hard (duh) but you will learn how to as they say *git gud* the graphics are phenomenal and the gameplay feels amazing.   9.5/10 
fun

pretty good game
👍

Best game ever!!!
Marikas tits
If not the best, one of the best games ever made
hardest game ever played
Historically accurate to how my dad walked to school. Good job.
Ya, it's pretty good.
69 hours in still cant defeat ur mom

OhhhhhhHHhahahahahHAHAHAH ITS SO DAMN GOOD.
deserved game of the year. excellent art direction, gameplay mechanics, and so much content. I hope we see some added content through updates or DLC.
FUN
one of the best games ive ever played!
This game makes me furry
W game
it good
1st souls game and I did not feel like jumping off of cliff 90% of the time :thumbsup
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm yes dog
Game is good
Ring-o-ring-o-ring-o-ring.
swing swing stab stab execute, very nice
Mmmmmmmmmm
Pure miser....bliss. Pure bliss.
Good game
yes
Disappointing the game is LOCKED 60 FPS there was some screen tearing  i'm running 3070 within the first minute of the game refunded if you not worried about the game locked 60 FPS  but for now when they fix this or enable it i will buy it under $70 i will recommend the game due to the story
This has to be the worst game ever made.   It's broken, mobs literally smack you through brick walls. There is no way to find your way around, no help from the game to even get started, there is nothing. My god I wish I never bought this trash. How did it win GOTY?? Absolutely the worst game I have ever played.
One of the best games I have ever played. There is something that is so fun about being beaten into the dirt SO MANY TIMES that it somehow becomes fantastic. The sense of accomplishment that you receive from vanquishing an enemy, especially a great enemy, feels oh so satisfying that it becomes addicting. I cannot recommend a game that makes you feel as satisfied as this one. 9.5/10
ok so the game is well made but the lack of direction and substance makes it feel empty and aimless
This game does not deserve game of the year. It's locked at 60 FPS (disgusting and bad game design), the graphics are alright (not game of the year worthy), the voice-acting sounds like it was done by a Fiverr VA, the camera controls are annoying, and did I mention that it's locked at 60 FPS? I can't say anything to the actual content of the game, since I only played 48 minutes of it, but the issues earlier in this "review" are dealbreakers. I'm refunding it.
The undisputed G.O.A.T
the elden ring is real tho
good
Elden Ring is the second to last step to the perfect Souls game
uyog
I want to love this game but its too hard :( I need halp pweez
Absolute masterpiece.
Incredible
I killed a dragon
die
Too busy playing this game to give a review. Seriously, probably the best game that's come out in the past decade. This was made by FromSoftware, who've made the Dark Souls series (among other things), so expect very similar (but improved upon) combat to Dark Souls. Even if you don't like Soulslike games (I only played a bit of Dark Souls 3 and wasn't the biggest fan), I'd still recommend giving this game a try-- it's that good!
very good open world map with a lot of freedom and challenging bosses
four armed blue witch lady
Pinnacle of the Souls-borne works up to this point.
Would bonk with a big pokey stick again! 10?10
I only play these games because my friend loves them. If the multiplayer wasn't so dysfunctional, and the net code so bad and if you could turn off invasions then there would be a shot this game wouldn't to me suck so much. The game makers goals and ambitions are good, but the technology they use to implement is atrocious.   Random disconnects,  Unable to join games together,  Client side manipulation by invaders,  Net code for invaders or just co-op,  Having to constantly summon after fights, n Not being able to go back and explore together after you clear a boss,  These are just all piss poor implementation. Even in single player there are too many frustrating interactions with how the environment impacts you the player but not the enemies. There are no way to grind past difficult parts of the game by out matching it with levels after a certain point. Maybe one day the game makers will have the technology to make their back end systems and code match the beauty that is the visuals of the game. But until it does it you could just stair at a gorgeous landscape and punch yourself in the genitals to get the same experience or just get good.
i became depressed...
GOTY! Amazing Game
Ill be honest.  I've never really ever liked single player games. I've tried the whole lot of them, none of them I ever really liked or for any matter, got into at all. It took me a long time of debating on this one after seeing all the praise it got, but as you can see, i'm here. Some people call this game misdirected, or maybe even "too hard" But I call it the closest thing you can get to perfection in a video game. Here's why:  Elden Ring teaches you about discipline, it teaches you about commitment, and it also teaches you about freedom. There is a common misconception behind this game, some people say its too cryptic to know where your going. Which is the complete opposite of why this game absolutely excels. Elden Ring gives you absolute and total control of where you want your character to go in the open world it provided. You will rarely find any aspects of the game that limit you to where they want you to go. Making it the absolute holy grail of open worlds.   Elden Ring will help you with real life scenarios and issues, This game will ultimately help to train you to achieve your goals, because throughout playing this game not only to you have to manage your anger (as did I) but you have to push through when you find a certain aspect difficult. Which is why the intense difficulty of the game makes it different and refreshing from every other game currently out there.   The Story is stunning, as well as the visuals. Cutscenes are almost as if not more immersive than a film. You will find yourself immersed in the world of Elden Ring immediately.   Even if you don't consider yourself a video game type of guy, or a single player type of guy, I recommend you try this game out. Take my word for it, its great.
YES
Behold, dog!
el mejor juego open world a la fecha!
dog
goodm game ga
How can you really rate this anything other than amazing? There are plenty of other reviews that sell this game mine is just a number to support.
you already know the game is great.  bad things? (no spoilers)  - there is a lot less back and forth than previous games. you have to wait your turn to do damage to a lot of the bosses.  - open world elements like catacombs are really repetitive, and only worth it if you check ahead of time for the rewards in each one.  - the sprawling detail filled world seems to take a big dive in quality in the second half (after the big story midpoint) - boss runbacks are still really annoying. theyve added the totems to a lot of bosses which is great. but there are still tons of bosses with really long and irritating runbacks. 
Seek rump.
Very fun
the final boss looks like a childrens drawing of an ethereal dildo dragon.  fights like one too.  play any of the other soulsborne games, even ds2, and you'll have a much more fun time.
The next evolution of Souls games! Truly beautiful and haunting game.
good 
Never Played a souls game before, hands down one of the best games ive ever played.
Vast open world
yes
bad game no fun
I love everything
Really fleshed out combat game-play supplemented by stunning visuals. It never gets old testing a new weapon or spell on some enemies, or finding a secret mini dungeon hiding between the rocks. I easily sank way too much time into this game, and it's open world quality lets you go as fast or slow as you want to.
I'd recommend this game to people who are looking to challenge themselves, I have 97 hrs as of this review but haven't gotten very far (shield only playthrough is my furthest). stuttering can be a problem but is manageable most of the time, some enemies can be just unfair due to their "model box" and "slash box" overlapping (the collision push against your character prevents damage) at least for some weapons. I recommend not getting help from other players on first playthrough, as you'll probably kill fun bosses too fast to experience their movesets and have a gap in practice with later bosses.   In short: has some kinks but overall is a great game, experience it to the fullest :)

Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It adds so many satisfying systems to the From Software "Souls" formula, but stands wholly on its own. Fun that it had some literary influence on its lore with the GRRM collaboration, but From adapted whatever they got into something very much their own. I found the difficulty curve a bit steep toward the end, but really the game has an incredibly versatile set of tools and builds, makes it satisfying to play again and again. I do wish you could get the sorcerer's book as a weapon, really my only disappointment with this game. Oooohhhhhhh...
Fun game.
gud gam
okay, I kinda fixed the game & i'm having better performance
this game gives me nightmares
400+ hours on ps4 and rebought it for steam and speedran the achievements for 100%.  Another pleasurable playthrough, and amazing world design and lore. Kinda sad no where to buy pvp items/consumables but the colloseum update is amazing nonetheless.
You either love it or you hate and I love it, 15/10.
Game is really fun!!!!!! Easy AF frfr
This is one of the Greatest Games I have ever played in 27 Years of Gaming. Made my top 5. A truly remarkable experience. Cheers to Miyazaki And The From Software team for this incredible Feat. Vast Open World that never felt Dull. Incredible visuals and remarkable design in all aspects. A brilliant Sountrack and impeccable gameplay and steady Optimization my whole experience. I am also very thankful it was not riddled with 8 hours of cutscenes. Masterpiece. Ranni is my Baby Mama.
I have played this game for over 60 hours and still have not finished the game. It makes me want to punt a child but is still one of the most beautiful games i have ever played.
Love this game!!!
Don't buy if you have loved ones
w  riz game hahahah buy it plz i need money hahaha
too buggy and shitty mechanics
Elden Ring is awesome. It's a cool mysterious world to explore. Looks and sounds great.  Its a really nice evolution of the souls formula.  I does kind of run like garbage though.  I've tried everything to get it running smoothly, but it still has pretty noticeable stuttering.  Playing on a new top of the line gaming PC so it shouldn't be having any issues.  Despite that I'm still enjoying the game quite a bit.  Just wish it was optimized better.  I still recommend it if you don't mind putting up with a little bit of jankiness.
elden ring!
This isn't going to be in depth. Dark Souls 3 was updated to open world. The whole game is easy mode now.
Best soul game
not quite dark souls 2 but acceptable
Im upset Ive died 67 times definitively a fromsoft game
Being a Souls Veteran for many many years, I was exited at first when I heard there would be an "Open World Dark Souls game" And I have to say I was not disappointed.  The Game has :  Fascinating story with tons of hidden lore. A very In depth combat system, that rewards research and practice of skill. Stunning Visuals and breath taking views of the landscape.  Its such an amazing game, I am super exited to know what the future holds.
i think i have a kink for malenia after playing this game...
h
cool game i think
Took me 200 hours to beat it. As someone who likes to take their time and explore as much as my intuition guides me, this game is a GEM. I don't think the story is even slightly good, at least as far as presentation, and most of the quests do a really bad job of getting you attached to characters or even allowing you to understand what's going on at all, but that is overshadowed by the fact that the combat and exploration are so incredible, that I've never played a game that even comes close to how pleasant these aspects of the game are to interact with. Not even Breath of the Wild comes close. Elden Ring does everything Breath of the Wild tried to do, but better in every way. Dungeon crawling, exploration, stimulating a sense of community, combat, etc.. Even in way of the story tbh, and I personally really don't care for this game's story (even after watching dozens of hours of lore videos) so that's saying a lot lol.  This game is one of — if not — THE BEST video game I've ever played. It's not perfect though. I personally don't like that the game discourages you from experimenting with weapons by forcing you upgrade them before they have any meaningful combat effect. Some of the quests are just ridiculous and force you to use a guide or have a friend tell you what to do, which don't get me wrong, isn't just clearly a bad thing. When Zelda came out, a goal for the developers was to put in secrets and whatnot so that players can share important details with each other and stimulate a sense of community. Because of the cryptic nature of Elden Ring's quests and general design, Elden Ring succeeds in creating a healthy sense of community, which I believe Zelda failed at, especially in comparison to Elden Ring.  Elden Ring will leave its mark on gaming and will change the way developers move forward and make decisions. By missing out on Elden Ring, you're missing out on history. I've heard this kind of praise before playing the game, and was iffy about its validity, but I was wrong to doubt it.  Incredible game. Deserved Game of the Year, and honestly deserves more than just that.
Even I can beat this one :D

When you finish a good game you say "It was nice". When you finish a great game you say "It was a blast ! I will play it again another day". With Elden Ring it's different... You wanna call your mom to brag about how you defeated final bosses as if there is nothing more impressive in life than that. At the end you expect her to say "first off, well done". Masterpiece 11/10
Amazing. Simply Amazing.
Game of the Year 2022! The environments, music, and level design are top notch! It'll keep you coming back for more. There's so much content and so many playstyles that it is worth coming back to.  The only downside is the balancing with enemies in that it can feel kind of cheap at times but overall I give it a 9/10.  Another banger from FromSoftware!
this game constantly reminds me who bad i am at games.... i like it
melania made me misogynistic
eh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yes 
This game is pretty good.
good
ok
The game is a console port and sucks
First souls game and I have yet to beat any main story bosses, the open world feels dense but not overwhelming and makes it fun to wander around doing whatever you want. I've accidentally made it to end game areas rather even after not having beaten the first main boss and that was a mess but shows that even at it's high difficulty the user will often want to continue playing. Also I have yet to git gud
Well deserving recipient of GOTY 2023. Multiple playthroughs in the Lands Between will keep me coming back!
Everything
I WANT RANNI THIGHS HOLY FUCK WHY CANT SHE BE REAL WHYY GOD I WANT HER FOUR ARMS OVER ME WHY CANT SHE BE REAL WHY CANT SHE BE REAL WHY WHY WHY GOD WHY
Creo que me vine un poquito

Very good game, could take you 30hours to beat or 100h depending on how much time you want to play for! :) So many option boss fights, very good mechanics, and for £50 i and very happy. First in the dark souls serise to really hook me. The large open world lends it to exploration but with the help of torrent this is very quick to travel and his dubble jump is so helpful and just feels right. The game is a must play 10/10
Didn’t expect therapy
highly recommended, this was my first taste of the souls games and sense then, ive beaten ds 1 remastered and bloodbourne and theyre all amazing games with great storys that you can only start to understand by exploring the world witch i love to me this is what adventure games should be like because its an adventure in its purest form, youre free to choose what you do till the end and you arent walked through everything like a baby, its great.
GOTY
Terrible game. Unresponsive controls, poor multiplayer, bad lock on mechanic. Worst $60 dollars I ever spent.
Oh, Elden Ring!  *Small spoiler warning for boss names*  Absolutely brimming with great content, Elden Ring surpassed my unhealthily high expectations. As a veteran of the series, I was very hyped for ER (probably too much), yet the game still blew me away. The small dungeons were what I was most worried about. Most games of ER's size tend to re-use dungeons, and while some of them feel samey, they were clearly made with a lot of effort. Their difficulty progresses very well throughout the game, and the late game ones are worth every minute of exploration.   The bosses are outstanding, but Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne are still (in my opinion, this is very subjective) the games with the best fights in the series. Elden Ring's best bosses have minor flaws which make them just a bit more annoying than enjoyable. To give examples: Malenia's damage output and Waterfowl dance; Mohg's bloodflame covering the entire arena, making bloodloss unavoidable if you're too unlucky; Rykard's nearly unavoidable exploding skulls; Placidusax's huge health bar that makes the fight an endurance test like no other; and so on. However, don't get me wrong: All of these bosses are still very fun. These flaws are minor annoyances.   The music is truly outstanding, and I have nothing negative to say about it. Morgott, Mohg, Malenia, Placidusax, The Godskin Apostles, and many more amazing tracks are among the series' best.  The graphics are nothing revolutionary, but the art style is unforgettable. There is a geoguessr game for ER (lostgamer.io), but all the locations are so distinct from one another that it's very easy to guess them all just from a single playthrough. Boss designs, area designs, everything is so full of life that you wonder how they managed to make it all in 5 years.  Conclusion: one of the best games ever made, well worth the money, and then some. Fingers crossed that FromSoftware will keep up the tradition of making the DLC the most epic and over the top (in a good way) experience in gaming history.
I bought Elden Ring a few days ago and im addicted
Greatest game of all time
Great game, had some issues on launch with stuttering that was bad enough to get me killed a couple times, but they fixed it. Game is amazing now.
dark souls 4 is good, but it still has the core mechanics of dark souls, which are a little tedious and awkward, but when mastered people can pull off some crazy stunts.
good
You are maidenless 10/10
Openworld game developers, take notice
This game has to much of my time.....
tomatters 
good
Elden Ring deserves all the hype it received. FromSoftware took everything that made the Souls series great and spread its attention to detail, solid game mechanics and masterful world-building across the entire map!  The only gripe I have is that some of the questlines can become nearly impossible to figure out without the helping hand of the wiki page. But that aside, I recommend every fan of action RPGs to venture into the Lands Between!
Put these foolish ambitions to rest...
I sold my soul for this one.
close to a perfect game as it gets imo.
Easily my favorite game of all time. After the suffering comes sadness that its over
dis gaem sux
NIVCR
is good
This game is hard as hell and really rage inducing but its made to be like that. once you start geting footing in the world and get a handle on the game its really fun and satisfying. you cant mindlessly swing and must plan out your moves and have good positioning. it took me a minute to understand that i cant play this game without thinking. once i grasped that and started thinking about my moves i really started to enjoy my self and loved the challenges that i faced. once i defeated my first boss this game quickly became my favorite game of all time. 10/10 must play. although if you have anger issues you might want to play this game in burst and not a long time. might get expensive
Having played every Souls game...this is the very best one easily. Praise the Sun
This game has it all! Much better than God of War Ragnarok :)
My gf and I love this masterpiece but it is too scary for my tiny winy gf sometimes Miyazaki-sama uf
Get this game for the gameplay and exploration. The story is bad even if you read all the item descriptions and go on youtube to figure out what is going on and what tHE eLdEn rInG even is. From what I could piece together it's actually a blessing that they hid the story away, it's not something normal humans should think about. No microtransactions, NFTs and surprise lootboxes, rare these days so support it when it happens. PVP is bad, worst I've seen in a Souls game. So if you like gank squads this is the PVP game for you. You can duel and arena but the core Dark Souls invasion is just comicly bad.  Anyway have fun !
I spent 5.4 hours trying to fight tree sentinel. I am depressed, my parent hate me.

Great game. It is a must if you own a steam deck.
the easiest of all the souls games. not in a bad way. i do miss wiping on a single boss for days until i snap then give up and some how win finally, but with how much there is to explore. it makes up the hours for game play.super fun. so many O.P. builds. so many options of play styles, for so many options to replay over and over.

Elden Ring not only made me go from a 15 year old to a 75 year old. it also proposed to me. Therefore making me...an Elden Ring. Good game also cant wait for dark souls 2
Oh it's on PC, alright, main menu, "press any key" okay, let's press enter. So I press enter and the options come up to select new game or settings, so i try W for up and S for down, nope,  fair, i try arrow keys, yeah okay, works, so i press enter to select options, nothing... its E. you press E. so whatever i think right, i press E... so i think okay maybe wasd works now? no. no no. arrow keys, which fair, now i got it, menu = arrow keys and enter = nothing, enter does not exist. never did, its all a psyop. so i want to exit the options, i press escape.. NOPE...... you press..... Q.. whatever, arrow keys, Q and E, got it... you load into the game, to skip the cutscene you use ESCAPE, interesting... i got this now, arrow keys and E to select and Q to exit, got it... got into the game, arrow keys uses items now..... OK.... now its wasd to move, got it. then wait, i want to open menu, I think it was ESCAPE to open the in game menu, and which from there you use arrow keys to move... oh and its F to jump. game itself is fine though.  fromsoftware pc ports / 10
amazing game, everything looks beautiful, the fights are sick, theres nothing else to say. truly deserves game of the year!
play it
yes
GOTY for a reason. Overcome the learning curve and you WILL be delighted.
I like it
L den ring
Really, if you haven't checked out the new Dark Souls 3 Horse+Jump DLC you should. It's pretty good, and honestly I just enjoy more content for the 7 year old game. Bravo Miyazaki!
Questo gioco non è solo un Dark Souls in cui puoi saltare, è un open world originale e innovativo. Ogni dungeon, ogni singola zona di interesse da qualcosa di unico non randomico e realmente utile. Hai la sensazione che ogni singolo dungeon sia servito alla crescita del tuo personaggio e non perchè hai ottenuto 2 anime, 20 monete e 1 ciabatta in più di prima come in qualsiasi altro gioco, ma perchè hai ottenuto un oggetto che non avresti potuto trovare da nessun' altra parte e che potrebbe realmente servirti in futuro. Lo stile artistico è incredibile, ti fa dire "wow, che grafica pazzesca" anche se in realtà è una grafica di 5 anni fa, perciò non credete a chi dice che la grafica di Elden Ring è brutta perchè anche se dal lato tecnico non sorprende è comunque migliore di Dark Souls 3 ed è accompagnato da uno stile unico ed estremamente elaborato. Dal lato difficoltà non è una passeggiata ma poteva essere più difficile. Tolto il boss finale che credo di esserci arrivato sopralivellato avendo fatto letteralmente tutto prima di arrivarci, quindi credo sia normale mi fosse risultato troppo semplice, i boss dei dungeon secondari sono tipo 6 e vengono ripetuti più volte con qualche leggera modifica nell'arena e nelle mosse. Essendo di partenza non troppo difficili, capite che alla quinta volta che lo affronti è quasi un nemico normale, ANZI, certe volte lo diventa davvero. I boss di trama sono impegnativi, ma almeno io non credo di aver mai superato i 15 try con nessun boss. Gli unici boss che mi sono risultati davvero difficili, e quando dico difficili dico DIFFICILI, sono un boss opzionale e nascosto e un boss primario particolare dove dovresti evocare 5 - 6 persone ma l'ho voluto affrontare da solo, nessun altro. Tutti gli altri boss sono difficili solo se perdendovi nella mappa ci arrivate sotto livellati. Pecche del gioco? La magia. Oh, ogni arma che trovi 3 volte su 4 scala in fede. CHE PUALLE, ho capito l'albero ancestrale fatto di luce e sacro, ma cazzo se voglio fare una build no magia rispetto a chi ha fede e intelligenza posso usare 3 armi in croce, il coltello preso dalla cucina di Melina, una pantofola e i miei pugni. Ogni volta è un "Si, sapevo che c'era un dungeon qui" che finisce in un "si va beh ma che ca". Che poi sono pure fighe quelle armi, ma sono tutte in fede. MA a parte questo, le magie e le stregonerie sono rotte. Ho giocato insieme ad un mio amico con una build solo magia, io contro i boss con la mia build solo melee avevo una vera sfida, impegnativa e divertente, lui primo try, usa la magia da distanza, non ha bisogno di imparare il moveset dei boss perchè sta sempre lontano e fa comunque i miei stessi danni se non di più, easy gioco finito. In conclusione, gioco che merita, grande stile, impegnativo ma non esagerato come alcuni pensano, originale, estremamente rigiocabile, longevo e personalmente molto divertente. Alcuni mini boss sono troppo riciclati, le armi tendono troppo verso la fede e la magia è OP e rovina l'esperienza, ma non è niente rispetto ai moltissimi lati positivi che il gioco ha. Se vi piacciono gli open world rpg e non volete tutto servito su un piatto d'argento, è il gioco che fa per voi. Solo un consiglio, almeno per la prima run cercate di tendere al melee e non troppo alla magia, avrete un esperienza estremamente più divertente e soddisfacente
goood game
before playing i was maidenless. But after beating this game im maidenless with big fvcking sword!
GOTD  
Dog!
gud game
Its a Souls game. If you like them, you'll like this. If you don't, you may still like this.
God like
awesome

good game ya
I want to first say that I don't want to recommend, or not recommend this game.  For some it will be phenomenal, while for others it will be terrible, and that is just a fact.  It's a shame I am forced to select one or the other.  Since the game is so hyped in one direction, recommended, I guess I will do the opposite in the spirit of balance.  I don't get the appeal of games like this.  They are TOO hard to enjoy.   If you want the exploration that is expected in an RPG, you will find it here, but every bat can kill you unless you also enjoy mastering combat.  I don't want to do anything more than press a button to swing a sword, or cast a spell, and perhaps dodge or block like you do in GW2.  If you are like me then I recommend you avoid this game regardless of the rave reviews.  I played this game much longer than I expected because I spent $60 on it, but here are the issues as I see them:  Pros: 1.  Exploration of the open world is really second to none.  This is a fantastic open world with a mystery and excitement to it akin to Everquest 1 when it first released. 2.  The variety of mobs is fairly high 3.  The graphics and ambient sounds are well done 4.  The first act of the game, when mobs are not ridiculous and everything is new, is simply the best experience I have had in years.  Most reviews go on and on about this same thing so I won't reiterate it here.  What most reviews don't mention are the negatives, and there are negatives for many types of players despite the thousands of positive reviews.  Cons: 1.  Tedious:  if you die you lose  all runes which are collected like gold would be in most games, but are also the only way to level; you get one shot to pick them up again, but if you die they are gone for good along with every single bit of progress you have made in earning them.  Also, when you die ALL previously killed mobs respawn and you have to fight your way back through them.  I despise repeating things, and this game is designed to kill you over and over so you will spend a lot of time repeating stuff. 2.  There is no real sense of getting more powerful.  Sure there are mobs you eventually become stronger than, but you are always just a few unfortunate hits and stuns away from death no matter your level, experience, or gear.   3.  There is no way to adjust difficulty, so if you become mentally weary of the fights and just want to explore the world and story on a slighty lower intensity, you can forget it. 4.  After reaching the capital you will notice that mobs move beyond challenging into the realm of being unfair.  They have stuns, endless combos, ridiculous jumps, unblockable hits, and are so large and fast you cannot outrun them; nevermind the encounters in quests or dungeons which occur in cramped quarters where you have to master combat to have a chance.  You may like to master combat, but the truth is there is luck involved in many of the boss fights, and not everyone likes the combat as much as the exploration or other things. 5.  There is no quest journal to track steps completed, or even repeat goals or remind you of NPC names, or locations where you found them.  That isn't just not holding your hand, that is stupid and not respecting your time. 6.  The story really isn't very good at all.  I understand that is subjective, but many players couldn't tell you the story if you asked them, unless they had read it from a third party site.  Even if you do know it, it is boring, and RPGs are supposed to be story-driven, so a weak or non-compelling story-line is a problem. 7.  You will experience burnout if you are like many others who have stated they eventually just skip fights and run straight through zones in the endgame, just wanting to say they completed the game, and for it to be over.  In fact, I've read that many, myself included, have decided to not complete the game because it has become a chore. 8.  There are hidden features like using gestures to unlock hidden areas supposedly.  Well, you first have to find the gestures, then find the areas to use them, and then figure out which one to use.  I would normally like such a feature, but I find it annoying in this game.  If you try the game you will see what I mean. 9.  The game implements soft caps on stats to force you to diversify your build and try different things.  Look, if I want to max a stat and use the same weapon the whole game, then that is my business.  Stop artificially forcing me to try play-styles I don't like.  There is more to say, but there isn't much point when a game is so highly rated.  The game has real issues for certain gamers that will continue to be dismissed by the fans who say that I need to get better at the game.  But you see, I don't WANT to get better.  I just want to enjoy the Elden Ring world using MY playstyle, not yours.  This is one of the only developers that has decided they absolutely will not do that; it is their MO.  I am all about developers deciding what type of game they want to make, and sticking to it.  Elden Ring does that and I say good for them, but the result is a gamer like me is eventually driven away.  Fans of this series are happy about that, because they are so scared the things they like will be changed, or that their bragging rights will become meaningless as more people can kill the bosses they do, but I think this is silly.  There is some multiplayer functionality, but in the end this is a single player RPG and one gamer's sense of accomplishment shouldn't hinge on another gamer being shutout of the experience of the game to protect fragile egos and placate irrational fears.  Let as many people as possible experience and enjoy the fantasy world created I say.  For the reasons just stated, the game is so hyped that I believe the reviews never give you a fair assessment of the negatives, or at least the full picture.  This game isn't just "not for everyone because it's hard."  This game isn't for everyone because it has problems like any other.  It doesn't have the best boss fights that exist, even if that is your thing.  It is a challenge, and it is well done, but there is a HUGE segment of gamers that are also wasting their time with this game because it makes ZERO allowances for them in the end.    I find myself wanting to explore every nook and cranny because the world is that good, but I cannot stand the stupid boss fights and respawning of mobs anymore.  It has become tiring.  I cannot stand that I can't turn the difficulty down if I want to.  I cannot stand that  the game is designed to make you repeat stuff because it wants you to die to experience a sense of accomplishment.  Hey, if that's you then great, but it isn't me, and this game doesn't take a player like me into account.  I wish it did.
Amazing game from start to finish!
Game speaks for itself. I own it on PC and PS5 with at least 200 hrs on PS5. Absolutely in love with this game.

this soldier of godrick guy is hard man...
Only thing to say is this game is peak. Straight perfection 10/10 would play again (DLC PLS)
Fort, night.
7/10 Why? 1. The camera becomes a curse (malliketh and firegiant) 2. Some bosses are hard just for the sake of being hard and have ultra armor (malennia and radahn)  3. The game doesn't hold your hand (this is good) BUT the game doesn't point either, this is the first game where I have lost soooo many sidequests or have had to look up guides to play sidequests. Should have taken rdr2s logo approach on this.  Other than that, the game is worth paying for just ignore the Fromsoft elitists.
This game is great. It is a bit difficult, but just try to remember that you can always come back to bosses at a later time. You can reset your stats after beating a mid-game boss if you have messed up somewhere. Magic is very cool in this game, so try switching up your build every now and then. If you are having a super hard time, you can always look up tips or strats on youtube.
Finally I saw Naked Malenia , my life is a success
BEST GAME EVER
easiest game eva played
Pros: - Gameplay - Graphics/Artstyle - Story - Multiple Endings - Weapons - Characters  Cons: - Caelid  Verdict: Worth it at first full price!

G.O.A.T.
Great game.
Praise the Dog
Get ring, become king, win game, start over

gREATEST FROMSOFT GAME
ez game
addicting, beautiful vistas, challenging fun. may be fromsoftwares best game, hard but 9/10 deaths are fair. worth every penny. immerse yourself in the lore, different builds, etc. and never look back.
Tried to bonk and was bonked instead 10/10 would try to bonk again.
It's a masterpiece in every way possible; see for yourself.
Simply amazing game. I love how it doesn't hold your hand, is difficult to master and leaves an insane amount of freedom for exploring.
Đúng là game cho chó chơi :3
Great game
I only played it for a little bit, it's fun. Still can't get past that soldier of godrick guy.
Masterpiece.
I do recommend this game.  But as a newbie to the dark souls franchise, I found it easier to go kill that dragon for almost 100K runes and play the game like that.  Youtube is your friend here.  I mean, games like The Witcher 3 like you choose difficulty and then raise it as you get better and learn the tricks.  If you're struggling, go get that dragon and have fun. It's still plenty challenging even getting up to the mid thirties level to start.   Also I like to play my own ambient station in the background instead of the game music most times, unless you REALLY want to hear those drums for when enemies are near. But it's more fun and less depressing that way.  I use my keyboard keys to skip tracks.  It makes roaming around a completely different experience.
To be honest, when I started elden ring I was too scared to get into it knowing it was a souls game. I roamed around a lot in the open world levelled up to something like maybe 50-60ish till I went for the first boss Margot. And till I got to General Radhahn the game for not so difficult for me. I one tried Margit, The Golden Grafted dude who is a curse on the name of boss coz he is shit and too easy and Rennala too. I just believe if you roam and level up around in the open world and then go for the boss fights its much easier than just running from one important grace position to the other. Radhahn was a Chad though and Malenia made me give up hope on living until I finally killed her luckily seconds after dying.
This well and truly is one of the games of all time Highly yes
Really immersive game
THIS is the game of games.
Complicated, ugly and over hyped.  Like most fromsoft games this game is pretty difficult. This is not something that I enjoy or care for at this point in my life. Good luck having any sort of success in this game without constantly having to look up guides for bosses, weapons, where to go next, etc. For some reason there is nothing to aid the player with where to go next. No log or quest tracker.   Also the game is very ugly and dull to look at (compare with the vibrant and colorful environment of Ghost of Tsushima for instance). But perhaps this is not a surprise given how dull and ugly Sekiro is as well.   Personal opinion, but the game is overhyped. I purchased it on day 1 for PS5 and it never pulled me in. I played it for 30 minutes, put it down until a few days later. Then I did it a couple of more times before I decided to sell the game. I decided to give it another try on steam deck and I'll admit I got much farther this time than I thought I ever would, but that is because I had the help of an experienced friend. A positive is that it does a great job at making the player feel small in an over the top world.   Every time I start the game up I just want to uninstall. At this point in my life I do not find joy in games like this that require focus and patience. If you do not like to try hard then you will not like this game. Maybe if you have an experienced friend with this game you will have fun. I did not enjoy this game and I do not recommend it if you do not like a struggle. come at me elden ring fang@ys.
Good game
try finger but hole
git gud
Can Someone drop me all weapons, I sold them all.
Hands down, one of the best games ever made.  Period.
everything overall
+rep
A beautiful work of art.
We need camera mode.
Amazing game, tons of areas to explore not as hard as other souls game but it will def test you! definetely worthy of the GOTY it got .
best game
Easily 10/10 hard to find things wrong with this massive, beautiful jaw dropping game. so much content for your money, well worth.
daymn. best birthday gift so far
Game of the decade contender already. 10/10
Straight fire. Very nearly a perfect 10/10 [spoiler]godskin duo >:([/spoiler] Get if can there's not really anything else quite like this.
I really like this game! :D  Already put a lot of hours in it!   I can def. recommend it!
very good :]
Just giving my positive feedback for a game I enjoyed. The trick is taking it slow and not letting failure stop you from trying again. :)
Tbh i dont know how my monitor is not broken
Before I played this, I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
DARK SOULS IV
good game, fun, explorable
This game is an absolute masterpiece except for one thing....  [spoiler] THOSE GOD DAMN LOBSTERS!! ლ(ಠ益ಠლ [/spoiler]  10/10 Excellent game
This game is way too good , made me skip work for days ! long time I´ve played such a immersive game , Fromsoftware totaly out did them selfes and other game developers should should look up to them and stop this Battlepass/micro transaction bullshit business that is targeted on kids
Oooohhhhh The Elden Bling...
very fun game would recomend
first off, praise the Elden Ring!
One of the best games ever made, very worthy of winning GOTY, insane replayability with the insane amount of builds you can make, areas you can explore and different ways you can play the game. The main bosses are great (The last one is a bit underwhelming), the side bosses are okay, if you don`t like repeating bosses you can just skip them, the scenarios and the setting of the game is absolutely gorgeous, every weapon in the game is usable and can be pretty good if you know how to build around them, so every playstyle is viable.   The only area this game really lacks in is modding, modding is hard and a pain in the ass compared to most other games, also all the running around when in new game+ but that is understandable to keep the game`s progression path.  The only reason I can`t give this game a 10/10 is because that is of course reserved to the perfect games, with no flaws, this game has some flaws, the end-game is flawed, the last boss is flawed, and the endgame is pretty important to get right, but besides that it`s such a great game that a 9.8 is very much deserved and it definitely worth your money, it is a MUST PLAY game, and if you haven`t played any FROMSOFTWARE game before, just keep at it, don`t give up and you will have a great time.  [h1] IT'S A VERY SOLID 9.8/10 [/h1]
Best open world RPG hands down. That's it. Done.
played most off my time on steam deck and its awesome highly recommenced 10/10

....ELDEN! OOH UH- ELDEN RING, I GOT AN ELDEN RING! 
Hooked
kind of addicted, in a bad way  so yeah it's fun
Enemies with attacks cooler than your own. Over the top bosses that make your character feel shit. Slow lumbering combat, against enemies with lightning fast attacks. Terrible level up system with stats that make little difference. Terrible loot, I mean what loot? Open world that feels empty, with vague quests littered sparsely throughout. Npcs with no emotions and vague dialogue. Very basic enemy AI.  This feels like a game that was made decades ago and had a remake to look better. The only positives is that the game looks gorgeous, and the areas and dungeons are really well made. Even though the bosses are way over the top to your normal character they are also really cool.  The difficulty is all over the p[lace, some normal enemies will kill you instantly and the some do hardly anything, some little enemies are sometimes harder than the bosses. I think bottom line, people like the difficulty, and it's created a cult like following. But remove the difficulty and you will see how basic and boring these games actually are, and difficulty does not make a game better, a game has to be good even if its easy.
Frimble, I love you. Thanks for birthday present  Not a bad souls one. Find 'em boring usually, but this one is alright. Grind some dudes for their gear and have some fun. (Try seamless co-op mod on Nexus)
legendary
It's just awesome
First $60 game I've bought in 3-5 years that I actually felt was worth the price. I enjoy it, and I wasnt even sure if I'd like it, as I did not like the first Dark Souls Game (thats the only one I own). Give it a go.  You might find you like it and sink hours into it.
good
game is fun and all, but not for people who just started playing dark souls games, really tests your mentally and how calm you can stay during dying alot of times in games
Edit controls before play. Read the messages. Watch tutorials. Enjoy dying.
Could this be,  review?
Perfection: 10/10 I bought the game and got all of the game at once. (no special/custom armor/weapon behind paid extra content)  Thank you From Software

Great game to release stress or get stress
Too Hard 10/10
great game although a lil too easy tbh
is gud
It's like they gave Ubisoft a soulslike engine and told them to make an open world game.  Weakest story out of all the From titles I've played yet, vague with little substance below the surface. By far the most unbalanced and unfun gameplay, accidentally made an OP bleed build and destroyed the entire first 80% of the game and then had to spend overly difficult hours on the last few bosses, notably excluding Miquella and Mohg as I had accidentally cheesed them both with overpowered weapon arts and spirit ashes. (Bloody slash allowed me to kill Mohg without him reaching his second phase.)  A terrible symbol of the nature of broad and expansive open world games, which innovates in the first 20 to 30 hours with Liurnia being a great area, representing good world design with great encouragement of curiousity, and then the rest of the open world areas being largely bland and classic Ubisoft-y. An overall extremely disappointing game, largely helped by the INSANE hype. Geoff Keighley RUINED ELDEN RING!
play it for all the new holes your gonna make in your wall
If only I could be so grossly incandescent...
good
Imma name my firstborn Elden Ring
One of the greatest games of our generation
Very fun
Controller still working fine.
elde n ring
Great game!
pros:  good art style   Cons: recycled dungeons boss recycling bosses are sponges, combat feels like a chore 2D water in 2022 Bland open world  No actual story telling horrible quest design  Lego lord of the rings has ultra-wide support and a uncapped frame rate but a game released in 2022 doesn't lol
Pretty solid game, only really complaint I have with it is the difficulty scaling towards the end of the game. Shit gets pretty wacky after the fire giant and the game overall just felt like more of a slog to me from then on, especially on new game plus runs but i guess you could attribute that to burn out. The bosses at this point also took a turn from me really enjoying them to me just wanting them to be over with, though there's some exceptions like Placidusax. Anyways, beside the rough end game, it's still fun and more than worth your 60 sheckles.    also pls gib dlc michael zacki
good
This deserved Game of the Year due to its build variety, combat, bosses, accessibility, vast open world, and environmental story telling.
It's pretty good 
good
It's Elden Ring!
beautiful

Decent Game. Very well made.
ps4通两边，pc打折入了又玩了一边，真是难得的佳作，回味无穷
Enemies ahead
amazing
I've probably died at least once every 3 minutes
i decided to make a new character because after about 2 -3 months of not touching my first character i didn't know where i was at  that was less then a week ago and i already have 50 hours on that new character this game is taking all my free time and is amazing 10/10 would recommend
I hated every second of it, still haven't beaten anything important.   10/10 would die again
Some performance issues, but immersive all the same
W game very fun and fulfilling
man this game is addicting, im fail my class cause taking time of my studying
There is tons of content, Lots to explore, Items to find, and Battles Hard Fought. Great Game and Fun with co-op mod for seamless play.
Awesome game

Great game! 
how wonderful ! when there is such an excellent game
I died a lot
badass 
First souls like game I've played. I think it was an excellent first impression.
Only for those with good PCs (runs like shit)
Sure it has been said multiple times, for veterans, its a good game, not challenging enough to make them out-sweat the four great lakes. for a beginner, its a blast, it has ways to absolutely cheese the bosses, open world so they aren't having to look every 20 seconds if something is about to one-shot it. I would prefer this game to anyone who wants to play a souls-like.
Fromsoftware's whole library turned into 1 game.
good game
just epic
Worth every cent
Blueberry
Great game
Simply  Amazing
This game sucks. I'm not sure why people like this garbage.
A M A Z I N G  I can't wait for the DLC!

i think my friend Harrison should play this game he'd really like it
This game is a masterpiece af, but it has one major drawback. Even in this game I'm maidenless
This is bullshit and I can't stop playing it
Elden Bling

FFFFFFF
amazing game one the best games I have ever played 1000% recommended 
Seek rump
wwweeeeiiiieiiiinnnnnneeeeerrrr 
Really good, highly recommend. Good.
Son were have you been?  SMASHING POTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best souls game to me. It took what I loved from DS3 and turn it up to an eleven. Now DS1 has the best level design, but Elden Ring has the bosses, except for all of the repeats, and the cool ass weapons you can use. It is a must have.
I do recommend buying when it's on sale for it's amazing artwork, environments, and open world. But it being the year 2022-23, there's no excuse for the 8 bit vectoring/motion control, and sado difficulty. Perhaps expand Margit's Shackle use for mobs that are no longer level locked, yet due to controller/ keyboard limitation from varieties, are unattainable.   Messages and player blood pools do grief player experience – they will effect open world battles, entry ways, and portals. The differences between PC and console development make a keyboard and mouse play through  even more difficult.  This being game of the year (it will be) speaks strides to the state of the gaming industry. Most would rather play a somewhat abusive (and yet visually stunning) game than the other titles out there; on account that so many developers would rather lazily skimp on their products than put something out that works and plays as expected.
greatest game ever atleast that's how it felt most of the time. definitely game of the year.  my only criticism is how despite already releasing several entries on PC the game controls still based on console and you cannot bind the many items and spells to numbers.  also the quest system if you don't want to miss atleast half the quests you need to watch many youtube guides. there is no quest journal so expect to remember all NPCs and objective from your head a dozen hours in.  and theres still abit of stuttering lag a year later
good game
love
fun
Elden Ring
Dodge. Pray. Die.
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IM DOING BUT I LOVE IT!! THESE GUYS ARE MEAN
I've never felt as immersed into a video game before as much as this one. The graphics are great, the mechanics are fun, and the ways you can choose to approach combat is among the best with tons to casually learn. The solo experience and co-op/pvp experience will have you coming back. I recommended this to all my friends and I get to enjoy the immersion just as great as before. The replay value is great and I highly recommend buying this. Just know this, only the true gamers can handle the difficulty in challenge to become Elden Lord.
The music from booting up this game, made me go from beta to sigma
get buck
Incredible game in general... Poor level balancing is my only complaint.
hard
Fantastic game. So much to explore. Combat is great (as is tradition in souls games). You can jump!
this game is so destroy lonely
Fantastic game overall: extensive story line, captivating boss battles and scenery, vast open-world exploration and competitive PVP battling.
Everything
Easy GOTY 2022 and might be the best GOTY after The Witcher 3.
phonk.
good
this game is good if you don't value your worth as a human being
good game cause jay doesnt have it
amazing and addictive. if you liked Skyrim you will love this.
PIZDA
A good game, some say the goodest. I'd say between being the good game versus the goodest game, it is closer to the goodest game of time (all of it -- but definitely all of it in the year of our lord 2022).
Edit: i played more and my stance hasnt changed. fuck elden ring. i want my money back.  i hate this game because it gave me hope i'd enjoy it and then it took that hope from me. i want to fucking die and i can't get a refund because someone told me to give it a second chance. i am not friends with this person anymore.
this fun fr
Elden Ring is one of the most challenging games there is, while still being extremely fun.  I don't remember very many dull moments.  It is also, to me at least, the most beautiful graphics.   Each cave, tunnel, or catacomb (and their bosses) is different and it takes a while to get to know them well enough to get through them successfully.  I love the concept of summoning either spirit ashes or other players to help with the tough fights.  It can be a bit lonely in this single-player game so having that extra help makes it a lot of fun, even if you don't really need to use them.  It can be dark and very spooky at times; particularly when you're sitting at a Site of Grace and Melina suddenly appears and sits next to you.  The lore behind the story of Elden Ring is very interesting and sometimes a puzzle in itself, to be solved in later versions i suppose.  I have recommended the game to many friends and they have all fell in love with it as i did.
Great game. Really enjoying it! (please help me, I'm dying all the time.)
:)
This game makes me painfully erect.
thumby dummy
Elden Ring is like the culmination of every FromSoft game, taking aspects of each and mashing them together in yet another exercise in masochism. Visually stunning, large open world, solid and extremely unforgiving gameplay, interesting lore and characters, hours and hours of stuff to do.  Yes, it's difficult. If you've played anything from Demon Souls to Sekiro, you know that there can be a steep learning curve. But once you grow to master the combat, the game becomes all the more rewarding. It's like everything you wanted out of an FS title had a baby with Skyrim. Even if you aren't a fan of SoulsBorne games, Elden Ring has a lot to offer for most gamers who have patience and an open mind.   What are you waiting for, foul tarnished? Play the game.
I have a friend that played 25 hours of only the tutorial 10/10 for that laugh only
I played 27 hours of tutorial, best game ever. The WOW incident happened again.
good
elden ting goes tinky
It's better than my life
fromsoftware  never disappoints
Yes
you ever feel like a masochist?
Game's so hard, my PC can't even run it.
just a great game
Had a ton of quitting moments but always came back to try and beat whatever boss I quit on, easily my favorite rpg of all time.
Esse é o melhor jogo que eu já joguei. Não tenho muito o que falar, a não ser que esse jogo é uma obra de arte que todo mundo que joga jogos deveria experienciar pelo menos uma vez.    69 horas de jogo btw kkkkkkk
I wish i was elden lord

DA
the IRS is outside of my house
great game yes very good
It's alright ig
yes
is good game
Best game

The game looked really good and game play is ok.  The forced pvp when you try multi-player really sucks since i dont pvp. Wish i could get my money back!!
An open world Dark souls is just perfect, difficult but rewarding just as a dark souls game should be.
I don't care to be killed by a NPC but I'll just drop your game rating if you don't put an option to refuse to be invaded.
Orthodox rabbi Bill Clinton
This is the perfect game.  It has the perfect setting, with the perfect soundtrack, with perfect boss fights and learning curves.  Buy this game, play it. Have every game for you after Elden Ring, ruined.
You will die a lot. Not only in game.
Top xuxa
Do it. Get the Game.

It is fun.

best game 
the scope and scale is incredible
best soulslike evar.
yes
- You have 100 hours and you haven't gotten through the game yet? - Yes. It's not just a game, it's my life!
A game that's both a wonderful entrance to FromSoftware's catalog of games, as well as being an open world game to stand alongside the best of the best.   Throughout the game is a never-ending sense of wonder and discovery that, to the extent I've played, feels as if it's a living world all of it's own, with an extreme attention to detail in it's sprawling environment, and variety overflowing to the extent it baffles me that actual human beings could have made something this vast and creative.   An excellent game in almost every right, I hope to see more like this in the future!

Best game i've ever played
this game is good but unfortunately i: - have a skill issue (i'm bad at this game i die a lot) - hate dying and i'm impatient  if you like dark souls games, play this game, if you don't, play this game.. and be patient
Don't buy if you have an ultra wide monitor. Even though there is a setting for 5120x1440 the game doesnt run at that. They even had an update to keep Flawless Widescreen from working.
I am slowly losing my sanity. Please send help.
it ight
Tried it on release to see what the fuss was about. A year later and I've beaten every Souls game, Bloodborne, and Sekiro thanks to this Epic of a video game introducing me to the true meaning of "git gud."  10/10 god souls pilled would do again
Just killed the final boss... What the f*k did I just play. The graphics, the gameplay, the music, the atmosphere, the variety of enemies, the weapons/weapon arts and the story that even a layman like myself was able to uncover on my own, GOD tier. I have played the dark souls 1 and 3 and never found a reason to use a weapon other that a good one I found at the start and finished both games only using a single weapon from the start till the end. But elden ring was different. Even when I liked using a katana build I changed to a magic one the fist time ever, and then to a faith magic hybrid and the finally to the Guts Greatsword one. Everything you do in this game is not enough, you will find something new to do everytime you log in. Either a new weapon to try out, a new spirit to use in battle, a new area to explore, a new boss to defeat, a new adventure beyond what you just experienced. If you think I'm an "abuse victim" for liking elden ring, then YES, I am one.  Thank you Hidetaka Miyazaki Thank you Kentaro Miura
Yes
came for pain got waifus instead
Do you like over-the-top bosses and boss fights? Do you like games with replay value? Do you like open world style games?  Do you like a challenging but diverse combat system? Do you like ruining NPCs lives by trying to help them achieve their density or dreams? Did you like the "Dark Souls" series of games?  If you answered yes to some if not all of these questions, maybe give Elden Ring a try.  
The most beautiful fantasy world in games to my mind.

The best in the entirety of the soul series in my opinion. On my first playthrough took me about 35 hours without much guidance. Took me just under 100 hours to get all the achievements, including the time it took in making two characters and not really worrying about achievements in those playthroughs. Knowing where to go can be extremely frustrating at times. If it would be more fun to you to know where to go, then just look it up. Don't feel shamed out of doing so. Play the game how its most fun for you, as long as you aren't negatively impacting other people's playthroughs.
Try fingers But hole
Couldn't believe I left FPS titles such as Valorant, COD for ER. This was my first souls game and I'm loving it. Will try others souls titles after this.
Amazing game. Near endless replayability. The RPG mechanics are incredible. If you like a challenge and don't mind banging your head against a problem until it's solved, you'll love Elden Ring.
Its really fun and gives you alot of objectives and things to do during the game
Well, there is much to talk about this game, but when you end it it feels like nothing at all can be said...  Like the souls genre a good player can sense that the game itself get's smaller everytime you play. Of course there is not all that dramatic enviroment that exists in the past games but this void feeling unfortunly trys to tell the player something all the time. The soundtrack is quite adorable, and the conversations are unfortunely bad as it should be. Pherhaps the recycling of bosses during the game tries to explain itself what I'm trying to describe.  Sure, this is a "Game of the Year" and it deserves but it seems that some titles are a heavy burden...
GOOD THIS IS MY FIRST SOULS GAME
Beautiful. It's like a real adult TLOZ game.
I hate this game so much and I never want to stop playing it. It's awesome.
just woooow
amazing game. game of the year was well deserved above any other game. if you do decide to play this game, make sure to play it through despite your frustrations. it will be satisfying and worthwhile to play. The replay-ability value is endless as well. the best overall game i have ever played. i am glad to have been alive while this game was released.
bit hard but persistance is key here, generaly more forgiving than Hellpoint , more open spaces, and no evil twin of your character camping around place where you died, elden ring also has mount and mounted combat, certainly way better than skyrim mounted combat. sometimes has anoying things like camera turning at character body direction instead of keeping curent camera direction when pressed  target lock key on bit obstructed enemy

Is just not very fun. Not sure why people think its the game of the year.

The game is fine, fun even when you get the good stuff but I don't recommend this game if you have short patience I do not rate this game as difficult i would say it's more spam heavy and I love playing this with others but the other issue with that is when you connect with your friends you also get invaded by PVP again the game is fun but no game is perfect

good
Simply breath-taking
This game has some of the toughest boss fights in gaming but still allows you to play any style that fits you creating a balance between desperate button mashing and split second decision making. What a masterpiece of a game and well deserving of all the praise it has already received.
I both HATE and LOVE Elden Ring. I HATE being old with old man reflexes trying to defeat skill bosses.  I LOVE that after wiping so many times I still got them all. Played through as a caster and a melee.

WOW
This is seriously the worst game I have ever played. Better graphics does not mean better game. Selling this console trash for PC is just stealing money.
Spectacular single players experience, get seamless coop mod from ModNexus to play with friends without getting a migraine from connection issues. Overall spectacular game
No matter how much you progress in the game, you will always be a mushroom picker. Mushroom (1) from the ground, Mushroom (2) from an enemy. Mushroom (5) from a chest.  It's mushroom and excrement time.
No game has made me hate dogs more.
Awesome game, play it nerds
To Unga bunga or to not Unga bunga, that is the question
GAME OF THE DECADE!!!

Dying be fun
very nice

cant stop playing, i love the dark souls games and this is a fantastic sequal
Good
If you are on the fence about buying it because it's too difficult, then let me just say that it isn't, and that is coming from someone who isn't that good at video games. If you ever find yourself stuck on a boss, then you can always just go to another area, level up, and come back when you are stronger. This is truly an AMAZING game!

One of the best games I've ever played!
big dick playaaa
Wanted to like it more, but it is hard to like. It feels like someone just modded a souls game to have a seamless world map (which is very nice),  but it lacks the grandiosity of what new MMORPGS aspire to be, and life in this world feels like it was contrived from boredom or bedside notes from bad dreams.   again, I reallllly wanted to like it, but it is not really in my alley and I will continue to play it as there is some satisfaction in the exploration of it... I just don't follow the mainstream hype of it.
[b] At the time of writing, I have beaten Elden Ring seven times, almost beaten it an eighth time, and achieved 100% completion in terms of Steam achievements. This is a good game. A great game. But it's held back from being perfect by a couple things. [/b] Elden Ring is one of the most solid games ever created, and rivals the rest of the FromSoftware catalogue for best title they've ever created. The problem is, Elden Ring seems to have taken a tip from the original Dark Souls by making the second half of the game filled with unnecessary difficulty spikes, that make the game less fun and more frustrating than challenging. One such example of this is a section in the optional area of the [spoiler] 'Consecrated Snowfield' [/spoiler], this section is known as [spoiler] 'Ordina, Litgurgical Town' [/spoiler]. In this section there seems to be a lack of thought in the design, and it pairs the weakest part of these games - the platforming - with archer enemies placed in hard to reach positions that fire both very quick, and very fast. Alongside this, there are invisible assassin enemies who can crit you and then go invisible once more, leaving only a small window to actually hit them. Another example of this difficulty, and what I consider the main one, is the bosses - the bosses in the second half seem to have too much health, and deal too much damage, with almost all of them after [spoiler] Morgott [/spoiler] being able to 1 to 3 hit you depending on your build. This, I do not find challenging, just completely unfair; the worst offender is by far [spoiler] The Fire Giant [/spoiler] who might be the most infuriating mainline boss From has ever created. On the other hand, this title is the most expansive, most open and offers the most diverse build variety of any of the titles that FromSoft have created before. I also think this is among one of its most polished titles, which is why the unnecessary difficulty in certain sections makes it so frustrating as a title. Why bring down the quality of this game by designing unfair, and thus unenjoyable sections in a near perfect title? I think it has something to do with the legacy that FromSoftware has left behind with their souls-like genre; that of the idea that a souls-like must be difficult. This in turn can sometimes result in artificial difficulty over real challenge in order to make the game fit this image of being a 'difficult game'. However, I must whole-heartedly recommend this title, as it's easily one of the best games I've ever played, and probably will ever play.
scrimbo scrumbly
dog, O dog
Not as frustrating as the other souls games which I rage quit lol.  The open world lets you just skip past things until you feel you are ready for them.  The open world also just makes it so much better.  Im not one for absurdly punishing games but elden ring let you level up if you need to by grinding and you can also find items and weapons and armor that make things a bit easier.  I still got my butt handed to me often, but not to the point where I hated it.  Outstanding game.
great game
played it for a couple of hours...it was good.
p good gam
10/10 harry potter simulator
i just cant get enough its too addicting
I don't usually write reviews, but this game is just amazing!  If you played it for a bit and decided you wanna give up, hear me out. Get through the first 20 hours of the game, it just gets better and better. Starting this game is like watching a show, first you are probably clueless, as you progress through the story (after some leveling and better gear), I assure you'd get pulled into the Elden Ring world. Follow walkthrough and guides makes it easier ( I recommend fightincowboy walkthrough on youtube). Put 40 hours into the game and I have only completed about 20% of the story content. There are still so much more waiting for me.  Game of the year well deserved.  Fantastic job FROMSOFTWARE!

One of the best game's I've ever played
I apologize for my ineloquency - I usually don't write "reviews" but I just need to get this out of my system, so to speak.  First things first, if you're planning to play Elden Ring as your first "souls-like" - please, try Dark Souls 1 instead. It's an all around better game.  As for this game, I can't for the [i]life[/i] of me fathom why it was so praised.  Maybe I'm just tired of the generic "souls" formula, or maybe it's just my MDD that keeps gets worse.  But Elden Ring - in my opinion - is by far the worst, so to say, "souls-like" developed by FromSoftware - Dark Souls 2 included. Now, I think the developers/designers responsible for creating the "overworld" map indeed did a fantastic job, and the beginning of this game was somewhat promising.  However, other than that - Elden Ring is a creatively bankrupt, tedious, unbalanced, at some points borderline broken and worst of all - simply boring - mess.  Balancing issues aside - the game's main problem, I think, is that it's obscenely bloated with copypasted content: - Copypasted locations - which ruined any kind of atmosphere/immersion and disincentivized any point in exploration - the strongest, so say, aspect of previous From's "souls-clones".  Even the major late-game locations are heavily, if I'm not mistaken, the correct term is - "asset-flipped" versions of previous locations - and there's only ~7 of them in the entire game.  The other ~52 areas are just small "mini-dungeons". They in particular are just horrendous. Sure, you get some kind of - usually worthless - item at the end of yet another Cave/Crypt (that's all there is to it to the variety). But everything looks exactly the same - what was even the point? I mean, it would've been nice if the combat system wasn't so repetitive, but unfortunately - it is.  Even Bloodborne did it better with its random Chalice Dungeons.   - Copypasted enemies. In comparison with From's previous titles, in which each area usually had an array of unique enemy types, Elden Ring exhausts most of its, so to say, bestiary in barely ~1.5-3 hours of gameplay.  After that, it's, once again - just the same exact mobs that exponentially turn into obnoxious damage-sponges. And it really doesn't help that quite a lot of creatures (and player's character) repurpose animations assets from From's previous games - mostly Dark Souls 3.  - Majority of bosses (a lot of which were reused as regular enemy mobs) were also haphazardly copypasted.  And all the story-bosses felt completely unimaginative, forgettable and, with exception to a couple of end-game ones - trivial.  I even bothered to stop leveling at some point and used a guide on how to NOT get accidentally overpowered - which is an easy thing to do, because this game has a rather broken progression system.  The battle content designers, also, seem to have ran out of ideas and made the main bosses rely on cheap "delayed" attacks, annoying lingering AOEs and 1-shot gimmicks - particularly towards the very end of the game. Which, in my opinion, made this game into the most "sluggish" one in the series, despite added jump move from Sekiro - especially for melee characters. Magic is completely overpowered, by the way - I refuse to believe it was thoroughly playtested. One of the bosses, in particular - "Malenia, The Meme of This Game" - was clearly not designed for Elden Ring's combat system at all. Honestly, just google it.  It's really unfortunate that they messed up that badly - especially after aforementioned Sekiro, which had amazing bosses and an even better combat system in general.  Well, to spout at least something positive - I'd say Radahn (a giant goofball on a small horse) - one of the main mid-game bosses, was pretty decent because developers for once actually tried something unique with this one... and he also looked memorably amusing.  But overall, I didn't like Elden Ring. I think it's a barely mediocre game and It's really quite a shame that it wasn't criticized into oblivion - like Dark Souls 2, for example.  And as an another little side note to those who for some reason liked PvP in previous games, even though I'm in no position to talk about it.  Due to severe balancing issues - PvP here is objectively broken, there's no faction system and invasion-mechanic is also fairly "strange" too.  According to developers, to make invaders less of an issue for players - it's now only possible to invade ganks/groups. I think it just encouraged the use of broken builds and twinking. And for some absurd reason invading someone during a boss battle is also possible and, I should add, there's an easily accessible suicide bomb flask which can 1-shot majority of players (was kind of entertaining a couple of times). Ingenious!  Anyway - again, I apologize for my insane digital rumblings.
it would be so much better if it wasn't plagued by old, lazy game design and mechanics, like the god awful, boring, tedious platforming and "traps" that are just cheap, lazy gimmicks.  They need to focus on the bosses and making more of those and harder than the worst parts of the game being more challenging than the actual bosses.
ez game T.T
A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illnes and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad I was able to play this masterpiece before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recomend to you to buy this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, bosses, ost... everything is masterfully crafted. Thank you FromSoftware for your game.
i mean, ive barely plated any of it and i already know its gonna be good, put a ring on it
Game of the Year 2022...  The world is gigantic, and there's lots of stuff to do everywhere. Most of the content is optional, so you can do it at your own pace and not feel overwhelmed.  Difficulty is medium-high at the beginning, but it dramatically drops as you advance and make your character stronger.  Main bosses are spectacular and each one is unique. Even some of the optional bosses are amazing.  There's lots of options in which you can play the game, so it has lots of replay value.
Best game I ever played pretty hard but everything has a patterns  and if you want easy mod use sorcery and magic  which makes the game super easy but you will   be called a beta male (doesn't matter if you are a girl or other 69 genders) so avoid toxic community and you will love the experience
is pretty and good

Joined fight clubs. Helped strangers out for hours. Dropped rare items for strangers. Invaded and was friendly. Plat the game.  Never once made a new Steam friend along the way. 10/10
peak game
after replacing the screen of my laptop 5 times, I still have not killed the first boss
Not 100% sure about the game, but Co-op mode seems clunky and not easy to setup, the way it works is really weird, which made me stop playing cause I wanted to play with a friend.  So after 30 minutes of play I stopped, requested a refund. But Steam declined the refund request with 30 minutes of play, just because I did not request the refund straight away. Only cause I thought I wanted to give the game another chance maybe after some updates or so. But now stuck with a game I don't play or didn't play.  Poor service by Steam ....
Terrible game. Games are suppose to be fun. The UI is not even good and the gameplay is enough to make you want to kill yourself over how impossible it is to actually play. Not sure what I was expecting from this style of game since this company cant make anything good. Save your time and money.  Game of the year? More like game of shit.
Didn't expect finger
good game
The Best Souls game made by fromsoftware yet.
dodge, attack, repeat
I hate this game
It's big Dark Souls.
Everything Zelda BOTW Didn't Have, This Had. The Difficulty scaling, A Underground World To Explore, multiple Dungeons, Deep Story with multiple quest lines. All in All, such a fun adventure. The amount of dopamine you can get when you don't look up how to do something and just play the game and discover stuff on your own is astounding.
One of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth and engaging.
everyday i play this is constant pain waking up is pain this game has added to the many reasons i am going to end my life  it reminds me of the several family's that  i have left dead every night it was like a game to me to go out on the street and find the happiest family I could and take them and forced them to watch as i killed them    who typed that it wasnt me make the voices stop please help me  the voices are taking over i most end my life
Good game, should have bought this 10 years ago
After seeing probably around 98% of this games content throughout the course of over 130 hours on a single playthrough, Elden Ring easily makes for one of the greatest open world titles I've ever played. While I personally preferred the souls series' more linear style Elden Ring does do a great job at bringing the mechanics into an open world alongside so many small quality of life improvements that add up quite nicely. My main criticism would be that the overall quality of boss fights had some minor trade-off for more quality exploration but whether that counts as a net positive or negative is going to vary based on preferences. Mechanically it takes all the best parts of the Souls series and adds some great new elements, combat has so many more routes to find your preferred playstyle via Ashes of War, power-stancing, and mounted combat in many areas, new environments are incredible with particular note going to Caelid and the Haligtree as some of the coolest areas to come from a Fromsoft game, and of course practically bottomless rabbitholes for theorizing on lore. Absolute recommendation for anyone interested.

I am a fan of souls series, but what I loved about Elden ring is that, its open world isn't exhausting and consistently exciting. PvP is awesome and Gameplay is phenomenal.
Great soulborne combat and an open world are a win in my book
10/10 it's ok
bruhiz2gud4me
Thought this Souls like thing wouldn't be my thing, played this game and yeeaaaah. Has changed everything for me...Please check my wishlist and buy me the rest of these games :)) Would say 10/10 but there are some things that could be better but if you haven't played this game, you gotta give it a shot

This is one of my favorite games of all time. You never know what's going to happen next, and there is so much to explore.
it made me scream and cry. good game 10/10
single player is fine bosses are mediocre , 90% of the time they are just reused 5 separate times.  multiplayer is meta or die, all elden ring players know to do is use stab bloodhound step have level 5 profile and lie
long game but fun

Got my ass handed to me by a bird about 25 times. And I loved every minute of it.
Its a fun game.

The game is great, but with one caveat the mandatory PVP when doing co-op. The fact I cannot just play the game with my kid and enjoy the world without being ganked is absurd.
i consumed frogs
great game, get good ez clap
i actually have ... i believe 200 hours on elden ring. Maybe?? 300, i havent played my ps4 version in months Regardless, i play another game thats similar to his named biomutant and i honestly cant get enough of them. biomutant is not a souls game but its an open world, self interactive story where you decide what happens.  i would recommend elden ring to anyone who wants a fresh game to play. i seriously enjoy the game when i dont think of it as a souls game. i just explore landmarks and do stuff, collect everything, find everything there is to discover. even the enemies can make the game entertaining sometimes. Biomutant is kind of emptier though, but this is about elden ring. environmental story telling is just fantastic and its even better when you get to experience the character quests and how they affect the elden world.  ive never played dark souls or any souls like and they arent my type of games but elden ring is..... it touches that spot in videogames that i love  Game of The Year // 10
So hard......
avoid the big guys at first
It won game of the year for a reason.
ran out of sippy sippy :(

Fromsoft wont add dualshock control scheme. Yes I am this petty since it's pretty much a controller required game and I'm not buying a whole ass controller to tell what my button prompts are.

Fun and can be challenging but Malenia really made me want to throw my pc out the window.
Love this game.

 Since no one else is talking about this game, I will. do yourself a favour and play this hidden gem.
BEST >>> JUST BEST
pongan los dark souls en oferta kbrones
this is going in my suicide note
love this game
This is a game I would recommend to anyone. Despite it's well-earned reputation as one of the more difficult AAA games to come out in recent years, it keeps itself accessible to players of all skill levels.  Beyond the fact that you can summon friends to play almost the entire game for you, there are so many different weapons, spells, summon-able creatures, etc. that you can really tailor the game to be as difficult as you want it to be.  This is truly a top-tier game that people will be talking about for years to come, don't let it's tough reputation scare you away!
Elden ring is an AMAZING game. The bosses are fun, the gameplay is good, but hard. Overall, an amazing game. Yes, there are some issues. The main issue with the game is the fact that you have to sink around 18 hours for the first dungeon, but it's great. I recommend this game for players that love the Legend Of Zelda, having a great and challenging gameplay, but good story too. Overall, Elden Ring is a 7/10 for me.

held off on playing it with the idea i wouldnt like it and i regret doing so, amazing game.
I'm in love
Have tried about 5 of the characters so far. Death becomes me. Anticipating this will become a game I will love to hate. It will take many hours because apparently I'm a klutzy noob that is slow about getting gud.
One of the best games ever made. Period.
best game i have ever played
incredible game, i had only played dark souls remastered before this, my main account is at level 282 with 92 hours, i just got every achievement. there are so many different builds you can go for, 10/10. deserved game of the year, cant wait for dlc
nice
Elden Ring is so fuckin’ amazing!  Hidetaka Miyazaki, From Software & George R.R. Martin really out did themselves!   If you liked Demon's Souls or Bloodborne, you'll love Elden Ring!  I was amongst the 1st people to platinum Demon's Souls on PS3 when it originally released and before it got popular, I utterly LOVE Elden Ring!  It runs silk & butter smooth with highest settings on my Steam Deck 512 too!  Do It! Don’t be scared!
very fun, a bit hard but that is what makes the game so good
544 hrs and counting, excellent graphics, super tight controls and mechanics. great gameplay and interesting story when pieced together. Character building is super fun and in combination with the amount of items and content to explore replay value is tremendous. 
You need to be careful before buying this game.   There is no need to debate if this is a good game or not, it has past that point. What you need to think is do you have enough time for it. I was supposed to take an exam for promotion, got it all planed out. But then i got this game during Christmas. Then, 254 hours of game time within 1 month, while working a full time job. Yes, 1 month, 254 hours is the time I needed to feed my addictive mind of this game, before i can finally start to focus on something else.  I am giving it a negative review but doesn't change the fact that i call it game of the DECADE.   You have been warned.
Very good if you want to have an amazing experience while repeatedly bashing ur head in a wall at full force. I still agree with this statement.
11 of 10 game turns you into a Chad. could use better mouse and keyboard support tho.
Can't stop dying, I hate this game so much, it's so miserable, it's unfair. 10/10 would totally recommend and definitely deserves GOTY.
its pretty good
Super fuckin' overrated
Current Addiction. Will add more when I complete it.
I mean Its ELDEN RING what is there to say.
W game
This was the most fun I've had in a game in a long time until I met Malenia.
GREAT.
it is pretty cool and good yeah sure
Masterpiece
One of the best games i have played yet. period
Okay game, until it decides to start spiking your fps down to 10 with a second long freeze every minute. new free Hard Mod DLC apparently lol. Feels empty and too big for no good reason other than making a large open world game. from someone who loved ( and finished ) dark souls 1, 3 and Bloodborne, this is quite underwhelming. don't get me started about PC port optimisation, CPU usage and lack of feedback/updates.  game literally became unplayable 53h in................ what a waste.
one of the best games ive ever played. this game is hard but thats the fun of it having no power over anyone then defeating a boss is the best feeling. one of the best parts of the game is when your just roaming around then you find a good weapon or rune. but the BOSSES ARE THE HARDEST THING I HAVE EVER FACED!!!
so good
RING 
THIS GAME PISSES ME OFF. I LOVE IT. 10/10
Best game i have ever played. Its unforgiving, but very rewarding. The art, the music, the environments, boss fights, mechanics, surprises, build variations.  If i could summarize i would say the attention to detail in this game, shows the devs like their jobs, like playing video games, and like life and pizza and everything good.  I am not even done with it yet, and i keep thinking "how can this be one game". If EA would have produced this it would have sold it as 8 different games.  
Lay your ambitions to rest
Design wise is not up there with the rest of the souls. And the open world model just doesn't do it for me since it is not a story driven game. Still if you like dark souls you'll probably enjoy the combat. It is... the same. With all the good and the bad of its predecessors.   Technically wise it is a disaster. Frame drops, stuttering and not tight and responsive controls is only the beginning. Wait until you can torrent it. Don't give money to developers who are not optimizing their games for PC.
It got game of the year for a reason
i mean GOTY 2022. Need i say more?
dying is fun.
Its actually the best game I've ever played, just not a fan of getting to the final phase of a boss and putting them on 2 hp dying than restarting, its a challenge and that's was makes it so incredibly fun, the scenery is really stunning. I reccomend this game to anybody looking for a challenge
love it, praise the sun
Back to my roots.
10/10, first soul games to play and this is going to make me play more soul games
Honesly derserved game of the year
yes
I hate this game, it's too punishing. That said, I'm going to play it now.
Seek Youtube many o' man explain better
Truly an epic game by all means. Breathtaking scenery, intense and very satisfying combat gameplay. The variety of gameplay options kept me engaged for hours on end. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience.
I cannot play dark souls games why did i even buy this?  Oh hey I can play this one and actually progress and get better. Didn't see that coming.
it's good for a souls game, one of the best even, bosses get re used far too often and ER seems obsessed with delayed attacks but otherwise I can't complain about it.  I want to hold all of Ranni's hands.
Will be even better with dlc just like DS3
sex
Brute force the game
An outstanding edition to the Souls series. One I believe all should try at least once and dip their toes into the beautiful landscape, fantastic score and thrilling boss fights!

This is Dark Souls, but with an open world, and this is the biggest disappointment. The open world is not really interesting to explore and it serves only to move from one dungeon (or world boss) to the next one. And the dungeons and bosses are subpar to Dark Souls 1, I feel. Maybe that's because that game was groundbreaking in many aspects, and Elden Ring is just more of the same. In fact, it really feels like a remix of every other Soulsborne game, and the only new move is the ability to crouch ala Sekiro. There's nothing really innovative in terms of content: the weapons, the enemies, the location design - we've seen it in FromSoftware games before.  Does this mean Elden Ring is a bad game? No, and I totally recommend it, but only because there's nothing else of the same quality on the horizon. But Elden Ring could have been so much more, so much better. Alas...  Honestly, after finishing the game with 100% achievements and beating all key bosses (including Malenia), I can definitely say that the hardest enemies in the game (as in all other Soulsbornes) are camera, controls and performance. I thought 12900k and 3080Ti would be enough for 1440p gaming for a few more years, but no, FromSoftware managed to keep the videocard at 80-90% load at all times, with fps sometimes dropping to 40-50. And camera + controls is the same clunky stuff that I remember back from Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Also, data streaming is really bad. Despite me having 32Gb RAM + 980 Evo Pro, sometimes the game totally froze when loading in a new part of the location.  Well, in the end, it's part of the FromSoftware games DNA, I guess. If they were perfect, they would be too easy. In fact, Elden Ring is already much easier than Dark Souls 1/2/3 and Bloodborne, and even infamous Malenia is not that hard when you exploit her weaknesses (I killed her with a bloodloss build). For instance, it took me 80 hours to beat every key boss and do everything in Elden Ring, while the first Dark Souls took me 70 hours to beat, but I only killed one DLC boss out of three. And I played over 100 hours of Dark Souls 3 without getting all the achievements. So even though the game world looks massive, in terms of length Elden Ring is shorter than its predecessors due to lower difficulty.  So, bottom line, a good Soulsborne game, much more user friendly than the previous ones, but not in any way groundbreaking.
Its painful but fun.
perfect
if you like souls games, this will give you some challenge. It is not like others but still just like others souls games... Fast, so you better keep a clear mind and not just smash buttons. One mistake and you're out. 9/10, would recommend to all dark souls veterans.
%100 recommend this game to anyone up for a challenage. This was my first souls game and i have enjoyed it so much. I got it on my Xbox before my PC so in total i have about 300-400 hours so far. Between the endless builds and items there are and PVP there is so much to do. Not to mention The countless number of mods people have made. There are 4 different endings and a ungodly amount of dungons to explore. I would diffently recomend it to anyone intrested
Good game. It makes you want to play it. Replay-ability is a given, especially if the first run is blind. Missing stuff doesn't feel that bad and as long as you don't grind (and clear areas as much as possible in order) you'll usually enjoy every boss fight.
game gives me dementia.. I love it

Great game it was a breath of fresh air I had moments on my weekend when I just would play this in 10 hours session I bet the game six time and received all achievements
Just beat Godrick.
It's a great game. The best souls-like Fromsoft has ever created.   Just don't play PvP.
allot
The best game of all time played it 2 times over and im starting my 3rd definitely download seamless coop off nexus mods to play with ur friends completely changes the game
It's like a less structured Dark Souls with women that I wish to engage in intimacy with.
behold, rump
Lets start of with this. I have never played any other souls game before Elden Ring. I did not know what I was getting myself into when I first bought this game. I was recommended this game by a friend. I thought this game was going to be a breeeze. Boy was I wrong. The hours, and frustration I had gone through was a pain, but every boss was such a great feeling. I had over hundreds of hours in Elden Ring on my PS5, and went it was on sale on Steam, I had to buy it a second time! I can play this game for hours and hours! Totally recommend this game, but beware of tons of frustration and stress!!!
If this didn't win GOTY I would do terrible things.
one of the best games of all time
i like dying
penis 
I AM SO BAD AT THIS GAME  10/10
I found out you can kill a Dragon by hitting it in the armpit when he's sleeping. Which gets you 100,000 xp, and you get even more if you eat a bird's foot, this is a good game.
pain in fun
eeeexcellent
She is a 10 but she uses waterfowl dance on you.
The game thought me that i can hate something more then myself Would play again
The game is great on a controller.  The mouse and keyboard controls are awkward, and not everything can be rebound.  Upon starting the game, the icons that tell you what to press are for the gamepad not K&M.  You have to go into the sound (yes sound) menu to change it.  I can't recommend this to people on PC who aren't also going to use a controller.  Also the game can take seconds to minutes to shutdown properly before your cloud sync can begin.  This is incredibly awkward if you play on multiple devices and shut one down before the game actually exists.
Amazing
its gud
Um jogo simplesmente perfeito! Todos os finais são ótimos, além do enorme mapa e infinitas possibilidades de criação de personagem e gameplay! RECOMENDO 100%.
wow
it got me addicted
Incredible game!
Ta bueno
game good. game fun. game always fun. game hard :~( but game still fun.
big fun
Pros: Massive world, tons of content, challenging fights, rewarding gameplay, amazing art, great soundtrack Cons: tree sentinel
Incredible graphics and world. in-depth story line. Very rage inducing, but very rewarding. I would definitely recommend this game! Be aware, lots of hard battles and loss of runes.
Game of the decade
You gonna suffer through all those tunnels just to get a all the weapons you don't have the build for
m azing gamd
BEST GAME EVER!!!!
The perfect game for masochists.
Is Elden Ring. Is open world Souls game. Is good.
better off buying it on your old ass granddad PS4 game is not even optimised for PC what so ever big ass waste of money no clue how it got voted game of the year
TRY FINGER WRITE BUTHOLE
gg
very good game just hard
I Just Finished The Game Today And The Question Is How Good This Game Is? Answer Is Now, I Want To Leave This Boring And Awful Life And Live In The Elden Ring World And I Really Mean It! This Game Is Life Itself! I'm Done! BYE! Yeah...  
Prisoner class = Griffith
GitGud
that shield......THAT DAMN STONE SHIELD
Haven't even dipped my toes into the game fully and I already love it!!! 10/10
Great game, world is amazing from what i have seen so far, my only issue is the camera is the worst thing ever. and the gameplay feels really clunky, i feel like the game is easy but the camera & clunky auto aim and combat make it more of a struggle than anything
Dying 60 times to a boss is so fun
Great coop game. If you enjoy doing coop, make sure to check out the always on coop mode.
This game is great
this game has got me hooked. Other souls games never got me hooked like this.
If you have ever played Dark Soul games, then be prepared for a very unforgiving and challenging game.  No hand holding in this game, you have to discover everything in this game on your own.  So I would suggest newbies to this game to do some research on it before you start as there is a lot to learn, the learning curve is high.
This is a game I continually come back to, over and over again, just to immerse myself in this world while also trying my hardest not to die to everything out there. I love it.
Game of the decade, worth every cent at full price.
I've put 60+ hours into this game over PC and PS5 and it still feels like I haven't even played two thirds of the game.
goog game
This is probably one of the best games ever made. I just spent the last 3 days attempting to beat Malenia, fuck everything about that boss but god DAYUM this is a good game
The first soulsborn game I started, played, and "finished" (read as getting an ending on the first playtrough). I never thought when I started my journey in December last year that I would just a couple of weeks later (playing other games and life in general in the meantime) actually beat the final boss.   Yes, I did cheese with leveling, yes I did use some overpowered equipment, yes I did a lot of reading up and using guides to help me complete this journey. But I don't regret it, so I could actually experience what this game had to offer. And was I NOT dissapointed.   I will even consider it to become on my list of favorite games off all time, and on must play/recommendations. If I can beat the game, I think way more can. And the statisfaction of actually doing it, I haven't felt that from a game in a long time.   I will absolutely come back to the Lands In Between again, try a new build, or play through NG+.
Precious item ahead.
Fun game, might complete the game again.
Alright, Looks like If you mess around with the windows registry. get the game to perform much better. https://youtu.be/9McWiB9ij4I?t=322  Game is great, Feels good    The open-world game has excessive stuttering issues despite trying various fixes such as lowering graphics and adjusting the NVIDIA control panel. The performance is also impacted by running background applications like Docker.   I cannot recommend purchasing it at full price on PC in its current state.  Graphics: 3070ti CPU: Ryzan 5800x Ram 32gb
goood
game good
Pain
was a blast, open world is huge and without errors, interesting story
gud gaym
cant sex 👎
As a fan of souls-likes since Demon's Souls on the PS3, I can say with full confidence that ELDEN RING is the best the souls-like series is gonna get, from sprawling, detailed, open worlds, to tough and interesting bosses and enemies, the Elden Ring experience is something that old and new players will enjoy and revel in its unforgiving, yet rewarding landscape. And if it's too hard for you? GITGUD...
I have gotten ready to punch holes in my walls many times.
I came
Elden Ring is probably the most fun and engaging collectathon I've played. Ever. Theres lots of weapons and armours and characters to unlock and collect, and the puzzles and challenges are incredibly rewarding. Really looking forward to getting everything in the game! One small gripe- the game can be a bit difficult at times? Not sure if my 6 year old son will be able to beat it. All in all though, really good game. 11/10.
Peak gaming
Pretty good game, but I wish they'd remove some of the useless UI elements like the health bar.
best open world exploration game
e
crazy game
The longest and most content filled Souls game ever made. Lots of possible builds along with flashy movesets for weapons and magic. Really interesting story with multiple endings based on your progression throughout the whole game.  First playthrough took me 100 hours to complete, going through most optional areas (not 100%). Lots of optional content, keep in mind that there are quite a bit of reused bosses and enemies (some are reskins, some are direct copies). I do not believe this game is as replayable as the others in the series due to how massive the game is. The best part of this game is how it naturally nudges you to explore, without revealing too much. There cool twists and bizzare creatures that must be slain!
Rise, Tarnished...  Let those words course through your mind as you take up arms and battle against legions of mighty monsters and gods on your journey to become Elden Lord! Do you have what it takes to succeed, or will you be trampled underfoot mercilessly by the likes of Godrick the Grafted and Malenia Blade of Miquella? Only you can answer that question, lowly Tarnished. Though patience and discipline are necessary to succeed in these harsh lands, I know that you can triumph, lowly Tarnished though you may be. Now, rise if you would, for that is your fate!   Beautiful, stunning game. Could not recommend Elden Ring highly enough. The Lands Between has been the most gorgeous setting in a game that I have experienced in a very long time. The story and characters are hauntingly sublime. Though challenging and at times frustrating, the experience has been truly exhilarating and wonderfully fulfilling. Praise the Elden Ring!
 epic
turn back before its too late
duh
yes yes yes good
theres a lot to do 
a painful fun journey  10/10
UJYG 
gud

Great game, a true masterpiece. 10/10 GOTY
its good i guess
GOTY

Great game even now.
fat roll
You can get lost in this perfect open world. So many secrets, so much lore to find out and the gameplay is Soulslike the best you can get. A masterpiece 10/10
great game, very hard, but after many deaths you get the hang of it and soon you become the bringer of death
50 hours in, was finally able to beat soldier of Godrick
miyazaki's done it again
Great Game !
Cmon man just buy it already
LOVE it soooooo much
I was maidenless when I first played this on release, however this has since changed. Now we are playing through the game for the first time togethaaaaa. Thank you Miyazaki
1v1 Malenia or you are not even a real elden souls lord of harry m night shamalan
10/10
Is this game fun? Well... It isn't like going to the beach fun, or making out with your sister fun... It's more like shoving shards of broken glass up your ass and taking a bath in Tabasco sauce fun.  If you woke up this morning and thought "Man, I just really don't want to enjoy myself today. Like I really really just want to have a terrible time." then look no further! You've found the perfect game for you!
yuh
Grrrr *flips my entire room upside down (cutely)*
Best game of 2022!!!
good
Very good game, love from Japan❤
i would recommend this to other soul playing brothers, we are already trapped in the abyss that is known as the dark souls series. as for the others who have not touched a souls like game, run while you still can. save your self. we are already trapped.
This game makes me cry every time i play it and i love it.
Beautiful game with rich, wonderful lore.  Unnecessarily hard.  Lacking basic QoL functions such as a quest log or mini map.  Very limited online options.  Not mod friendly.  There's a reason why Skyrim is still going strong all these years later.
good maidens
Best game. 10/10
Many I know gave up the game after a few hours, so it isn't for everyone; it is an extremely challenging game coupled with beautiful graphics and astonishing story.   Game of the year 2022 is well deserved but also an understatement; easily one of the best games I've every played.
It's alright.
The Dark Souls of open worlds
one of the best games ever made
Elden ring teach me to find your true companion like radahn and his horse
sexy game
yes
you're gonna die a lot
Hello chosen undead. I mean unkindled.... no... ashen one? Oh tarnished! This time you are called tarnished, whatever. (I'm wondering when will From Software run out of ideas what to to call your cursed husk walking the new land in each game) You are embarking on another Dark Souls adventure diluted in Open World formula this time instead of interconnected dungeons.   Yeah you were expecting the place to look quite f**ked up, and insanely beautiful at the same time, but these developers still surprise me in each game. So you walk out in this beautifully f**ked up world, and by the time you finish your gaming experience will be enriched once again with unforgettable moments, amazing boss fights, just as your vocabulary will be enriched with countless new curse words  Many called this game a direct evolution of Souls games, but it's more like a different take on the genre, changing the format instead of evolving it really. But it worked. Those who are new to these titles, because Elden Ring hype was great, definitely should go back and play some Dark Souls also. If you finished this, you can't say "I suck at Dark Souls" because you just finished one. And all these games are unique in their own way.  Oh, by the way PVP is garbage here also. So don't expect some well polished pvp. The latency is just as bad, or even worse than in any other Souls games, the amount of, bugs, gliches, bunny hopping, dodgerolling comedy is amazing :D Invasions don't exist either, they are invitations, they are only calling it invasions for the sake of calling it that.  Anyway, it's a must have, must play, must beat every boss game in your library, it met and exceeded all expectations. Cheers! 
i hated it.
すべての実績がアンロックされました。 時間を盗む泥棒、宮崎英高！『エレデンリング』は“The Game Awards 2022”年ゲーム・オブ・ザ・イヤーを受賞し、その名に恥じません! All achievements unlocked. Hidetaka Miyazaki, you time-stealing thief! Elden Ring, TGA's 2022 Game of the Year, deserves its name!
If you like Suffering i would recommend Playing Elden ring.
Loving every little thing about it, but most of all the exploration aspect is out of this world. I never know what new enemies will be around the corner and how incredible the landmarks are. Loving that they simply throw us in an unforgiving world and let us find out how to deal with it. Should you build strength, or sorcery, who knows. For maximum enjoyment I suggest to not look up any guides, unless you are stuck. Absolutely loving it!!
After only 4 hours of game play I've gone though the emotions, with raging and overwhelming happiness ... so yeah I would recommend this game buttt to the more skilled games!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Its Elden Ring how could you not love it
good
finger but hole.

very nice game and really cool graphics, but at the same time very difficult
One of the greatest games of all time.
Easy game easy life :thumb_nail: 
My first perfect game on Steam. Elden Ring brings the best of Dark Souls to a beautiful and massive open world RPG. Even more than combat, exploration was truly the most satisfying aspect of this game for myself. A lot of the very best content in this game is hidden behind obscure paths and caves making it so rewarding when you stumble across it. Massive cinematic set pieces in the background make not only for spectacular views upon high ground, but your next potential destination as you can visit practically everything that you see.   However, the bread and butter of this game is definitely the combat. Bosses are very difficult but very fair when taking into account the vast array of weapons, spells, armor, ashes of war, and spirit ashes. With so many choices, character customization has never been so deep in the Souls Series and when combined with the open world, it really makes for a wonderful RPG.  I really couldn't recommend this game enough. It's truly worthy of the praise it received and I can't wait for the DLC.
behold... one of the best games ever
I do not understand why the game is so hyped, if this is what a "game of the year" is, I am loosing my hopes.  The game was clearly made for consoles and porting the user interface and controls to PC was probably done by accident or an working student, but this is not the main problem. The controls are flawed even with a controller, for example there is no walking backwards or sideways which makes hitting enemies unnecessarily hard. The game concept is so swallow: Loot, Level, Kill... why? Because of a indoctrinating lengthy intro video at the start of game which spoon feds you the "why" in the fashion of a online training video about the new corporate culture. After this you a set free into a beautify looking, but empty feeling, open world with bare minimum physics and half brain dead AI... and for that you better pull out your reading glasses, because you are going to read a lot of tool tips trying to explain the non-intuitive menu. From this point on wards there is not much more going on that to loot, level, and kill poorly scripted AI that tries to kill you for no good reason.  For me this game has nothing to offer, because its just a grind for the sake of grinding without any real reward. I would refund it if I would not have bought it with a discount from a 3rd party.  TL;DR: Nothing is interesting beside the pretty game engine. Would refund if I had not bought a key from a 3rd party.

what a journey
Don't give up. Don't give in. Git Gud.
nice 
Amazing
Best platformer of the year.
truly fun...very recommended, worth the money and the time.
mimic is the friend we made along the way
The lands of Elden Ring are vast and wild, filled with dangers lurking at every turn. But, there is also beauty to be found in this world, and I found myself drawn to explore it. The combat in Elden Ring is a true test of skill and bravery. I've faced challenges I never thought possible, but with each defeat came new knowledge and the desire to try again. The story is like nothing I've ever encountered before. It is a tale of power, of magic, and of destiny - I had to lookup a whole lotta youtube videos for this. The soundtracks are like haunting melodies that lingers in my mind long after I've stepped away from my PC.   This is my first "souls-like" experience, each victory feels earned and I find myself eager for more. The game is a masterful fusion of difficulty, atmosphere, storytelling, and exploration, and is sure to be a memorable experience for those who embark on its journey.
Cant Segz Godrick
